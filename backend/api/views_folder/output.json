But there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that\u2019s it. Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time.",

I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.\n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape.",

But depression itself can make it impossible to act Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to \"be good for your mental health\"... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.\n\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\n\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.\n\nIt's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.\n\nMore than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the comments. I didn\u2019t expect to get any response.

Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. \n\nAlso to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing :)",

I'm having a terrible time but my friends and family are all enjoying it so I stick around. They're the ones that invited me and said I'd have a good time. But as time goes on, the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so I try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but I still really just want to leave. But everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that I should just stay and try to enjoy myself. But I'm not enjoying myself. I'm just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol. I've got to the exit door a couple of times but I couldn't get any further than that. What's more annoying is that while I can get help to make the night out more manageable, I'm not allowed to just leave. I'm stuck here. It feels like this night out has just turned into a prison sentence.",

But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.\n\nIt's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.\n\n When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. \n\nSorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.\n\nedit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling.

I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped.

I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.\n\nI can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. \n\nI'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. \n\nIt has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay \"depression stupid\" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.\n\nEDIT: This blew up over night, I'm thankful for the lively discussion in the comments, thanks for the awards.

I\u2019m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn\u2019t show up. This was my attempt to \u201creach out\u201d. Update:\n\nSorry in advance, I\u2019m on mobile and this is long. \nI really wasn\u2019t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! \n\nI\u2019d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.\n\nNext I\u2019d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn\u2019t know I had. \n\nI also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn\u2019t angry at her because I understand that she\u2019s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I\u2019ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! \n\nI\u2019m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn\u2019t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven\u2019t dwelled on it too much. She\u2019ll reach out when she\u2019s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven\u2019t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what\u2019s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I\u2019m better off being out of that toxic environment but it\u2019s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. \n\nI\u2019m also struggling with my marriage. I\u2019m a military spouse and it\u2019s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won\u2019t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it\u2019s been traumatic and hard. I haven\u2019t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I\u2019m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. \n\nI also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn\u2019t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn\u2019t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. \n\nIt just would\u2019ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would\u2019ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. \n\nIt\u2019s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. \nI also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!\n\nTL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I\u2019m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn\u2019t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",

Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.\n\nThe kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of \"you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there\", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.\n\nI've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.\n\nAnd with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.\n\nI wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.\n\nEdit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.\n\nEdit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",

I didn\u2019t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn\u2019t control. Now I\u2019m 21 and just graduated college and I\u2019m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore.

I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven\u2019t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we\u2019re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn\u2019t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she\u2019s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We\u2019ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn\u2019t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I\u2019m still upset about it.

We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.\n\nI have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.\n\nThe woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to \"covid.\" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am \"allowed\" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.\n\nEventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.\n\nI decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.\n\nI am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.\n\nI dont know what to do.

And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.\n\nSo my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.\n\nThis is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.\n\nEdit: I don't know what to say right now...

She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. \n\nI thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any \"normal\" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. \n\nHere's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me \"not having enough social activity\", as \"not having enough will\", and have called my therapy \"a waste of time.\" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. \n\nAny and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",

    "postText": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I\u2019m getting more and more depressive Hi y\u2019all,\nWell I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.\nI\u2019m a 20yo man. I\u2018m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.\nI grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I\u2019ll call her Honey in this post.\n So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.\nWhen I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to \u00ab\u00a0flirt\u00a0\u00bb. Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren\u2019t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.\nWe kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it\u2019s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more \u00ab\u00a0serious\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0(important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn\u2019t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.\nThen when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it\u2019s unusual.\nBut we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that clich\u00e9 of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I\u2018d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.\nWe graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn\u2019t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.\nWhen I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.\nWe were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn\u2019t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I\u2019d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I\u2019ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.\nEveryone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.\nI felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I\u2018m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.\nWe were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it\u2019d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.\nWe were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it\u2019s extremely harsh.\nIt was a Sunday and we were at our parents\u2019 for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.\nOn Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents\u2019 and me at mine, there wasn\u2019t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It\u2019s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I\u2018d never forgive myself.\nIt\u2019s an ongoing case so I\u2019m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn\u2019t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).\nI cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.\nSince I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn\u2019t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I\u2018ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.\nI haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.\nI feel even worse since I know who did this and what their \"reasons\" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.\nHer parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it\u2019s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.\nPeople tell me that one day when I\u2019ll be happy again and I\u2018ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it\u2019s wrong, first I\u2018ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it\u2019s unbearable to survive since she\u2018s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn\u2019t now that I\u2018m desperate without her that I\u2018ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she\u2018ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I\u2019m \u00ab\u00a0relieved\u00a0\u00bb that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.\nJust before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don\u2019t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very \u00ab\u00a0strong\u00a0\u00bb and now I\u2018m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they\u2018re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.\nThe only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I\u2018ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).\nI\u2019m not afraid of the judgement, I know they\u2018ll have a long sentence but I\u2018m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they\u2018re going to say, I\u2018m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I\u2019m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn\u2019t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it\u2019s, when I\u2019m there I feel calmer.\nI feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don\u2019t think anyone will have read this anyway.",

Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I\nmessed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don\u2019t have the money for the trip, but that\u2019s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. \n\nSorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head.",

All the things we have been through, he has been there for me like no other person in my life has, all the play and joy, hardships, running in and out to the vet, petting him and loving him, waking up every morning with him looking at me and meowing, following me downstairs and watch me make coffee... and now, all that is gone. It's like he seized to exist, wiped out his hard drive.. I got him when I was 14yo, my cousin gave him to me, when she learned I had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father. My life was in pieces... But my cat, he mended my heart. He gave me love and support when no one else did. He was there for me, always, no matter my mood, and I loved him so so much... Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo... But not making contact with me, not cuddling, not meowing. I look into his eyes and I don't see him there anymore.. I am so sad right now I don't know how to think positively about the future without him. I feel completely shattered..",

I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can\u2019t lose my life over some girl. \n\nSo here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can\u2019t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I\u2019ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.\n\nI would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn\u2019t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they\u2019re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it.

I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. \n\nI can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn\u2019t help. \n\nThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with me. I\u2019m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I\u2019ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. \n\nI\u2019ve been told I am strong because I haven\u2019t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven\u2019t killed myself. I\u2019m not strong, I\u2019m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. \n\nLove doesn\u2019t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I\u2019m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.\n\nI tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. \n\nEven the \u201cgood\u201d therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn\u2019t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. \n\nMy mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can\u2019t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn\u2019t make me feel better, just guilty.\n\nAll this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn\u2019t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn\u2019t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. \n\nMy only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won\u2019t affect anyone.\n\nEdit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily.\n\nI really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood.",

    "postText": "Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. \n\nI laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. \n\nI don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. \n\nIt's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything.

I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. \nI truly appreciate it.",

    "postText": "I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression? The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied \"200 km/h\".\n\nI have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.\n\nI drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).\n\nThe everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It's a miracle you're alive\". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).\n\nIf anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.\n\nPlease help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.\n\nHere are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:\n\n\\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?\n\n\\-How can I keep up or have more energy?\n\n\\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)\n\n\\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression\n\n\\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?\n\n\\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?\n\n\\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just \"disappeared\" for a few days?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\n\nEdit: more questions\n\nEdit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life.",

I've been feeling very suicidal the past couple of days. The only thing that stops me is my baby brother I take care of everyday. When he goes home though, I don't know. I just hope my mood is better by then. I know part of me doesn't want to die but the feeling is so forceful and impulsive.",

I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted.

After years of trauma and abuse, however, depression completely overcame my life, and after so long, I feel it has utterly destroyed my brain; fried it, like an overloaded computer. I genuinely forget how old I am sometimes. I struggle doing basic math. My short-term memory has deteriorated to nothing. Etc. I just feel as though I'm slowing down only more each passing day. If I can ever beat depression, would I have any hope of restoring my cognitive ability at all?",

This thought of regrets have tortured me so much: a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me. In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that \"no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.\" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be. To be honest, I don't know what a solution could be here, but I suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle. ",

    "postText": "I wanted to kill my self last night but instead I called an ambulance No real reason for posting I\u2019m just proud of myself for making the choice I did.\nEdit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don\u2019t want to stress people out. I\u2019m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I\u2019ll slowly get to each comment as I can \ud83d\ude0a. Firstly the cost- I\u2019m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can\u2019t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn\u2019t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn\u2019t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn\u2019t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I\u2019ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don\u2019t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it\u2019s referred to bulk billing. Basically it\u2019s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn\u2019t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn\u2019t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven\u2019t meet her yet, but basically she\u2019ll contact me regularly to see if I\u2019m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I\u2019m struggling too. I\u2019ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward.",

    "postText": "I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. \n\nEver since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he\u2019s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he\u2019s done with me.\n\nMy 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.\n\nThen he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an \"ass whooping mood\" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.\n\nI'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.\n\nCan they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.\n\nHe doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\\*\\*\\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.\n\nWhat will the cops do about it when they come?",

Thanks for the \"help.\" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.\n\nI am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.\n\nAll I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go \"that sucks, pass the apple juice\", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.\n\nI don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.\n\n**EDIT: I'm seeing a therapist online.**\n\n**EDIT 2: I can't say I'm feeling better than I was yesterday when I posted this, but... a Platinum, a Gold, Silvers, so many kind comments... I truly don't know what to say. I wasn't expecting this to get so much traction, and I'm so close to crying at seeing so many people reach out and...** ***care***. **I'll try and respond to everyone when I can. Just... thank you, everyone. For helping me feel a bit less alone.**\n\n**EDIT 3: Well... I don't know what to say. I was okay for a few days after posting this. Now the weight in my chest and the bad thoughts are creeping back in again. They just... are. Every single time I think I'll get better, and then nothing at all.**\n\n**It's like my body wants to be depressed. Now I'm just... fighting myself. I want to surrender.**",

One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. \n\nMeanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think \"if only she knew how I would turn out.\" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. \n\nAnytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses. ",

    "postTitle": "I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.",
    "postText": "I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time. I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.\n\nI had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to \"reason\". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, \"I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him.\" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, \"Okay, night.\" \n\nMy niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for \"keeping things going\", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.\n\nThen, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, \"I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house.\" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, \"I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?\" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.\n\nFinally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, \"Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life.\" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm \"letting it bother me\" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, \"If you get a job, you'd have more money.\" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, \"That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly.\" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more \"realistic\" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not \"getting a life\" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the \"therapy friend\" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. \n\nAnd go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for \"checking up on her\" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?\n\nI don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get \"advice\" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these \"sessions\", lol.",

I feel like I\u2019ve reached my breaking point. \n\n\nIm so tired. I\u2019m so tired of existing. I\u2019m so tired of being mad. I\u2019m so tired of being tired. It\u2019s pathetic. I\u2019m a 25 year old adult who\u2019s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I\u2019m reaching the point where I\u2019m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I\u2019m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I\u2019ll probably sink. If it\u2019s sink or swim out in the big world. \n\n\nI am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can\u2019t cope with in a healthy way.

I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C\u2019s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying \u201cwell Don\u2019t choke him (insert name)\u201d and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying \u201cI\u2019m not choking him\u201d I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. \n\nBut you know. Now that I\u2019m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I\u2019m going to get my ass beat I\u2019m going to get my ass beat. I\u2019m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}\n\n\n {my thoughts on my brother}\n\n{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I\u2019m concerned we probably won\u2019t ever speak again. Let\u2019s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to \u201cwake him up after rugrats\u201d when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you\u2019re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn\u2019t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don\u2019t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there\u2019s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. \nWhen I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he\u2019s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse \u201cisn\u2019t this okay because it\u2019s what dad used to do to us. \u201c of course having a criminal record he couldn\u2019t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she\u2019s gone it\u2019ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it\u2019s not full time and \u201cat your age your brother worked full time\u201d at my age y\u2019all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It\u2019s just never going to be good enough. \n\n\nLet me talk about our most recent altercation, because it\u2019s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I\u2019m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn\u2019t want to help which wasn\u2019t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded \u201cforget it\u201d and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother\u2019s defense I\u2019m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don\u2019t want to do something. \n\nGet to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn\u2019t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.\n\nHaving already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn\u2019t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn\u2019t want to be around any of them. \n\n\nThe next day comes and I don\u2019t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said \u201cwe don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll need you tomorrow or not yet\u201d so I just didn\u2019t bother to show up because if y\u2019all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn\u2019t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn\u2019t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up \u201cwhy should I have to explain to my boss why you didn\u2019t come\u201d \u201cwhy do you get to sleep all day while we work I\u2019m sick of it\u201d turning to my mother \u201cI\u2019m sick of him aren\u2019t y\u2019all sick of him\u201d (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won\u2019t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I\u2019m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I\u2019m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don\u2019t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.\n\n(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn\u2019t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn\u2019t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said \u201cwell he wasn\u2019t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.\u201d I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I\u2019m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She\u2019s talking some I can\u2019t I don\u2019t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn\u2019t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I\u2019m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don\u2019t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn\u2019t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) \n\nAnyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation\u201d to which he responds (talking out of his ass) \u201cwell you didn\u2019t pay for it mom did!\u201d Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there\u2019s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}\n\nThis whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. \n\n {my thoughts on my mother}\n\n{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I\u2019m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I\u2019m literally holding onto grudges that I don\u2019t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I\u2019m positive she\u2019s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. \n\nA few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I\u2019m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes \u201care you ready now I\u2019m not in a rush or anything\u201d I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I\u2019ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I\u2019m ready to go lol. Otherwise I\u2019d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she\u2019s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I\u2019m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It\u2019s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I\u2019m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me\u201d my response being \u201coh what I\u2019m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???\u201d which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don\u2019t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I\u2019m not mad and you tell me \u201cyes you are mad that\u2019s why you\u2019re being shitty\u201d that\u2019s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you\u2019re just going to decide I\u2019m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I\u2019m in a bad fucking mood then. \n\nSo this screaming match in my car leads to her saying \u201cI hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me\u201d. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I\u2019m inside of it, I hope it\u2019s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won\u2019t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn\u2019t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don\u2019t care about context with my car history\n\n(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn\u2019t at fault for but still it\u2019s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn\u2019t want a new car which I will explain why later. )\n\nAnd then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he\u2019s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn\u2019t literally crying \u201cmommy bail me out\u201d when he\u2019s in there. As he\u2019s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me \u201cyour ashtray is knocked over \u201c as if i wasn\u2019t outside and heard him kick it over like I\u2019m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of \u201cif he needs an ashtray he\u2019ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.\u201d Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. \u201cWell it is your ashtray...\u201d okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that\u2019s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. \n\nIn regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she\u2019s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don\u2019t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I\u2019ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn\u2019t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. \n\nMy father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don\u2019t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don\u2019t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I\u2019m chasing my mother\u2019s approval or some shit. }}}}\n\n\n\n {thoughts on my own disgusting self}\n\nIt\u2019s only been recently that I\u2019m starting to come around to my father and that\u2019s only because I think I\u2019m starting to hate my mother. \n\n\nI know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I\u2019ve been and all that I\u2019ve been given. But I don\u2019t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. \n\n\nAnd that\u2019s not to say I\u2019m perfect either. I\u2019ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. \n\nWhen I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that\u2019s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. \n\nBut as an adult I can see that\u2019s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it\u2019s just who you are and can\u2019t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn\u2019t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing \u201cdoctor\u201d with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That\u2019s fucking gross we were all kids. \n\n\nFast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn\u2019t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn\u2019t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don\u2019t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn\u2019t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that\u2019s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. \n\nThat\u2019s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn\u2019t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. \n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I\u2019m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I\u2019ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn\u2019t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we\u2019re so sorry don\u2019t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn\u2019t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That\u2019s another one that\u2019s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. \n\nBut since the recent heart break I\u2019ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I\u2019m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. \n\nI\u2019m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.\n\nI\u2019m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don\u2019t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don\u2019t turn them into jokes. I\u2019ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don\u2019t want to be one anymore. \n\n\nI doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. \n\n\n\nTLDR; I\u2019m a scumbag. I\u2019m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I\u2019m genuinely losing my will to live. I\u2019ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",

Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here. It hurts but I feel like I must press on.",

I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. \n\nAnyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we \"to cool off,\" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. \n\nAnyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. \n\n\nEDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. ",

I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.\n\nSo just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. \n\nAt that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. \n\nAnd even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more \"This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel\" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. \n\nThanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness.

I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.\n\nI always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it.

    "postTitle": "I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.",
    "postText": "I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life. First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. \n\nAbout me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. \n\nMy life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. \n\nI grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)\n\nIn the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. \n\nAfter he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. \n\nUnfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).\n\nAfter the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. \n\nShortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. \n\nWith my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. \n\nHe also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. \n\nGenerally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.\n\nHe somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. \n\nHis last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. \n\nHowever I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).\n\nIn general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).\n\nAbout me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. \n\nUnfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). \n\nI wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. \n\nThen I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. \n\nI started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.\n\nI have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. \n\nMy ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. \n\nI had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.\n\nI had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.\n\nI then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. \n\nWhen I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.\n\nAlso this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. \n\nMy job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. \n\nIn addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. \n\nI discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.\n\nIn the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. \n\nI have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. \n\nI generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. \n\nI also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.\n\nI must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under \"joke addiction or Moria\". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. \n\nConclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? \n\nI am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends .

Since this pandemic began, I've been experiencing a lot of guilt and remorse over very trivial, cringy stuff I did when I was a kid.

Is this a symptom of depression? Is it my low self-worth? I don't know why I feel this way. Does anyone have advice?\n\nThank you in advance.

I just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle. It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing. I took you guys' advice and spoke to someone I can trust about my stupid past actions and well, they thought I was worrying over nothing. This really made me feel relieved as I thought they'd be ashamed of me or something. It's crazy what your mind can convince you of. That being said, starting tomorrow I'll be working on my sleep schedule and treating myself better. If that fails, I will seek therapy. Good night guys, I can't thank you enough and I wish you all the best. I appreciate you all so much you lovely human beings\n\nEdit: I'm so glad to hear that some of you are also reading the comments on here and feel a sense of relief that this is more common than you thought, honestly I had no idea either! There's some great advice on here guys and I'll make sure to read back on it if I ever start to doubt myself again.

    "postText": "People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies. UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn\u2019t seem to give a fuck, I\u2019m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she\u2019s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we\u2019ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don\u2019t care. Pay more attention to the former.\n\nOriginal post:\nSeriously, fuck everyone. It\u2019s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who\u2019s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it\u2019s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.\n\nEdit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. \n\nEdit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.\n\nThanks to everyone for your comments. I\u2019m trying to reply to each one but it\u2019s hard to keep up, so I\u2019m sorry if I miss yours. Remember\u2014you\u2019re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.\n\nEdit 3: If you're in the US, UK, Canada or Aus, you can use this directory to find a therapist near you, read about them, what insurance they take etc: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists.",

Every action I take as a depressed person is actively going against the depression. Have to fight and resist it and not be consumed by it. And it's exhausting.

Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn open letter to all those people out there saying \"just be happy\". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic.

Last therapy session I was explaining to my psychologist about my 'inner Child' (an expression which I hate but it made sense at the time). I described how it felt like she was trapped in a stone room with one high window which she can look out and hear other kids playing outside. She wants to leave the room but she knows it's safe in there and that makes her frightened to leave.\n\nI drew [this](http://imgur.com/a/wIEFpRw) afterwards. I can't draw, but I hope someone else can relate to it.\n\nEdit: Damn this got traction! Thank you for the award and the upvotes. I'm glad that this doodle has touched so many people.

I\u2019ve been diagnosed with RA, OA, CPS, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, PTSD, osteopenia, high blood pressure, anxiety, severe depression, degenerative joint and disc, and a few others. I\u2019m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage. \nMy wife of 22 years was present for each diagnoses, as well as my younger daughter. She promised it would be okay when I gave her a chance to get out and find a better man. I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I\u2019m lying about the problems. I\u2019m on disability and can barely walk. She calls me lazy and stupid for not working when I really miss being productive. When my problems flare up and I can\u2019t do things, she gets mad. She has now taken $900 that is mine. I\u2019m at a loss. My wife was a wonderful woman. I don\u2019t understand. There are days that I\u2019m tempted to let the depression win and end my life because I don\u2019t want to live like this. I\u2019m done. I apologize for doing this here.

The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.\n\nEdit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out.",

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nWe try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under \"Community Info\" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). \n\n*****\n\nSorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under \"Community Info\" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  \n\nI'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's \"report\" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  \n\n*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   \n\n* \"I'm here to help\" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  \n\n* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  \n\n**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. \n\nIf you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  \n\nThanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3\n\nI know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. \n\nMy parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.\n\nMy friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.\n\nIt's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.\n\nSchool is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying \"mental health matters guys!\" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say \"its really important we look after our wellbeing\" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and \"talking to someone\", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to \"look after our wellbeing\" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.\n\nI have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.\n\nTheres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.",

Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  \n\nHowever, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a \"great therapist.\"\n\nThis therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the \"tough love\" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was \"beyond unprofessional\" and that I should \"drop her immediately.\" \n\nI actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. \n\nI was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?\n\n*LIL' UPDATE*\n\nWow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   \n\nI have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.\n\nWith that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. \n\nThank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace.

Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it\u2019s not resolved, NO amount of \u201csubstitutes\u201d can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can\u2019t close.\n\nEdit: wow I didn\u2019t expect this to get so many likes. My first post with over 1k likes!

    "postText": "I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.\n\nI suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.\n\nI also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou hold the suns warmth in your hand\n\nwhen you touch me I become your man\n\nto be thawn is not easy\n\nthe cold bites and doesn't feel right\n\nif you've been frozen for all these years\n\na layer of ice to cover the wounds\n\nyou melt my heart you melt my soul\n\nunlocks life and a whole new world\n\nI love you with all my power\n\neven though I never told you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwith the sun's rays dawns a new day\n\nbut there was something you didn't want to say\n\nfor cold winds can troubble a flame\n\nyou wanted to tell but not to hurt\n\nwhen the warmth had gotten so weak\n\nyou said that it was I who had ended the day\n\nthat the frost and ice had put out your flame\n\nyou left no please stay\n\nfor a sun needs fuel and a spark\n\na chill needs only a coffin",

    "postText": "25 years old with absolutely no friends I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of \"friends\". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.\n\nThis really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for \"friends\" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.\n\nAnother thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more \"fun\" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday.\n\nIt's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.\n\nIdk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it?\n\nEDIT: I'm literally crying my eyes out with the support that's pouring in and the stories you all are sharing. I had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me. I'm at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best, thank you for making me feel like I'm not absolutely alone. \n\n&#x200B;",

I\u2019m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I\u2019m fucking furious. \n\nSo after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. \n\nThis guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  \n\nI\u2019ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I\u2019ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it\u2019s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nBitch, I\u2019m not fucking fine. \n\nThere were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn\u2019t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it\u2019s just cannabis.  \n\nMy favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, \u201cwell no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that\u2019s not really an option.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I\u2019m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.\n\n\nEdit, thanks for all the support guys, I\u2019ve got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that\u2019s cool. \n\nPlease stop upvoting and commenting haha, I never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol",

Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.\n\nAfter doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. \n\nI am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. \n\nI've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. \n\nI am not a quitter nor will I ever be. \n\nAll I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start? \n\n\n\nJust needed to rant and vent a little. So if anyone actually read this far, thank you \u2764\ufe0f",

    "postText": "I plan to kill myself tonight with a plastic bag (suffocation) I'm 14\nmy mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say \"Your family will be sad\" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to \"Pray that I get better\" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I'm deppressed and won't let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me. I'm sorry.",

He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. \n\nEdit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly.",

She was my soul mate, we connected instantly when we met at work. I had currently been in a toxic relationship when we met so we didn't date until a year later. But we instantly became friends and after a little bit of drama we started dating.. but I knew by then that she was the one.  She understood me like nobody else and I understood her.  She was good at everything I struggled with and I was good at everything she struggled with. We never really fought we only slightly bickered from time to time but it was never anything serious.We were planning on finishing college and then we were gonna get married.  But we decided to go visit my family's cabin in the mountains with some friends, and on the way home my truck broke down. We called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it.   Then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend.  Once I  woke up I immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasn't breathing.  I tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and I can't stop seeing her cold lifeless face.  In those few seconds I lost my future and my other half. I feel so alone and don't really want to live anymore. I can't see a future without her in it, the thought never even once occurred to me.Because I know she was truly my soul mate, and I will never find anyone like her. I miss her smile and her goofy songs she would sing, I miss the way she would put her feet in between my legs before bed. I miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because I was being lazy. I just miss her so much and don't know what to do. And I want to believe that she is in heaven looking down on me but why would God take such a beautiful and loving girl away from me. I wish I had saved her, I wish I had jumped in front of her so I was gone and she could still be here.",

People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.\n\nI had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.\n\nI'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.\n\nEdit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, \"You don't understand!\" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.\n\nI do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading.",

This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don\u2019t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don\u2019t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can\u2019t call myself depressed, because I\u2019m not sad all the time. I can\u2019t say I have anxiety, because I\u2019m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don\u2019t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I\u2019m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don\u2019t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on.

I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice\n\nI live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.\n\nMy grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a \"perfect\" \"son\" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.\n\nAs you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.\n\nMy step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. \n\nI want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over \"no one really cares about you\" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships\n\nBut what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with\u00a0 women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem\n\nAll of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. \"No one really cares\" \n\nI feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult \n\nI'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from \"I hate myself and want to die\" to \"I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born\". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",

I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.\n\nI still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage.

For normal people with healthy brains (honestly do those even exist anymore?), whenever things in their life are going wrong, they do what they can to fix it and get better. For those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury, we've lost interest in caring for ourselves.\n\nThere's no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?\n\nI've grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just don't care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely don't see one for myself and I'm not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.\n\nThis has to be the worst part about being depressed. It's an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens. If that isn't the scariest illness then I don't know what else is.",

I wake up every day in a state of shock, overcome with dread. I sleep as much as possible, but I have always had insomnia, so I only get a good night's sleep every 2-3 weeks. I snap awake as soon as I start falling asleep. I've tried medication, therapy, and jesus, but nothing has helped. I recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me. He's emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day. I am moving out soon, which is great (I hope), but I am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear. Despite it all, I am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself. Why? I honestly don't know. Because it's expected of me, I guess? What do I want out of life? To be happy, of course! But we all know that \"happy\" isn't realistically achievable. Life is never perfect, so I guess I am aiming for something more modest, like contentment. To me, contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress.

When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down.

It\u2019s so weird that feeling nothing is the new normal for many , I used to think people were being super dramatic but that is really what it feels like . I think when I feel \u201c better \u201c , it\u2019s not really like happiness , it\u2019s more so that empty feeling that could pass for happiness / normality . I keep trying to force tears just to feel something ( as dramatic as it sounds ) , but nothing happens, I can never cry naturally , I have to force myself , and the minute I stop focusing on it , the tears dry up oops  . I feel isolated from everyone - like I can see my family / friends interacting but there\u2019s like this chain keeping me rooted in place if that makes sense ? All communication is too much effort ? Let alone movement . The feeling of nothingness is almost safer and more comfortable and reliable ? I kinda prefer it than being happy I guess . Happy makes me feel vulnerable or uncomfortable . Everything good and bad in life comes from feelings .",

People vent about how shitty their lives are going or how they\u2019re feeling (honestly; is anyone having a good time right now?). And the answers are usually: go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it\u2019s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.\n\nIt took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn\u2019t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can\u2019t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won\u2019t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That\u2019s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven\u2019t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I.\n\n/rant\n\nTldr: therapy isn\u2019t easy to get into and isn\u2019t cheap. \u201cGo to therapy\u201d is not a solution many people can take.",

People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to \"be practical\" and to \"stop being dramatic\" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for \"keeping going\" is just \"because you have to.\" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.\n\nEdit: Wow 1.3k upvotes and an award? This is the first post I've ever made here on this sub and you've all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much. I'm glad so many people get it.

Never had a single good relationship with anyone.\n\nThis all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the \"help\" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.\n\n\nEdit: Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore. I especially didn't know that so many could relate to these kinds of thoughts. This is the dark side of depression that people don't want to talk about. All I can say is that I'm still here for now fighting on another day.",

After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  \n\nIf you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click \"report\" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.

Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a \"community\" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.\n\n**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is \"notorious\" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish \"religion\".

Driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and (somehow) unlock my safe and shoot himself. Then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it.  He cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness, but as his father I have a hard time not assigning blame to everything I can think of that I might have done differently. I have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts. Feeling as though I passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors ( my therapist agrees with the latter). Any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old, and not blaming myself for everything ?\n\nEdit: update and more info. \nYou guys this chat has been amazing! Thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post! Thought I would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about.\n\nWe learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school. My wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself. The student told their parent the parent contacted the school.  My wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school. He wasn\u2019t saying much and didn\u2019t give any specifics to my wife about plans, just that what she was being told was true.\n      That night is when he told me of his plan but that he didn\u2019t want to do it anymore. My therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support, so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening. It went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him. I also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members.\n   The next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselor/licensed therapist. They talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him.  He will be having sessions with her regularly. \n   We now have open communication with him about his anxiety/depression levels. His thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal. He did tell me during one talk \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, but my brain keeps telling me I do\u201d. He\u2019s an very emotionally sensitive and has always been. He takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this. \n   I feel we have moved into a better space around the situation, and he is doing well. \n   Thanks again for all the responses, they have been validating and uplifting. You all are amazing and thank you for the support !",

I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. \n\nI can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...\n\nI've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... \n\nMy motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. \n\nOccasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. \n\nSome days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. \n\nEvery day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. \n\nThe best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. \n\nEverything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. \n\nMy life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist.",

Don't get me wrong many have benefited from this, but how many haven't?\n\nIt seems that for everyone these don't work they are followed with find a better therapist or working out will just release endorphins to make you feel better or some shit.\n\nIf only I had kept all the wasted money on therapy to pay 10 escorts instead, I'd be much better. Going to therapy just made me feel worse, no matter how many different I went to, and I tried group therapy once I felt better(which surprise surprise I got better when I wasn't going regularly to therapy) but that was a big mistake, group therapy fucked me up more, it just made me realize I'm actually even more alone in what I'm going through.\n\nTo sum up what was heard in therapy, ex promiscuous people who want love but regularly have sex complaining how they hate who they married and cheat on them acting like they understand the sturggle of a late virgin( I was 23 back then).\n\nOh and the workout part?\n\nInstead of punching my head and hurting, I now punch myself and see stars and get fucking dizzy, working out just made me stronger not happier, endorphins don't hit me, I rest between sets punching my head.\n\nAll this stupid advice thrown everywhere made me even more miserable.\n\nAnd the worst is how many act like they care about feelings but they're just virtue signalling, aka 99.9% of reddit.",

    "postText": "Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...\n\nHe begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. \n\nHe sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. \n\nHe would say to me \"if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die\"\n\nI had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.\n\nHe wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered\n\nHe was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.\n\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you everyone for the words and suggestions. I have read over each one multiple times. It helps. Sometimes the words from strangers and people traversing through similar waters helps. I will continue to read these. Thank you",

The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don\u2019t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. \n\nI now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. \n\nMy family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me \u201cit wasn\u2019t her\u201d I know it wasn\u2019t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn\u2019t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. \n\nI can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast.\n\nI looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists\u2026etc. it was never ending. \n\nMy mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. \n\nThe night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city. \n\nI want to let every one know that no matter what, cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously.

You can say the pain has pushed me to do stuff ( I started working on myself, meditating reading more, trying to excercize, damn I've started painting watercolor.

Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told \"things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience\"-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a \"depressed\" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.\n\nI was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with \"emotional disturbances\", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a \"friend\" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....\n\nWhile I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me \"we are not financially stable yet\". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.\n\nTurns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say \" I didnt think you'd ever find that\" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough \"homemaker\". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..\n\nWhile in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...\n\nUntil 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she \"heard\" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............\n\nOf course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......\n\nAnd then, I got Covid and almost died from it.\n\nIt's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so \"tired\" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....\n\nThese are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........\n\nCan anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that \"things will get better\"? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Fuck this shit, I hope I was born heartless and emotionless so I didn't care about these kind of people but I still love them even after they refused to help me. I hope I die a miserable death.

I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I\u2019ve pushed them away. I don\u2019t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don\u2019t even notice when I don\u2019t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive. Every single thing overwhelms me-the cat wouldn\u2019t eat the food I gave him today because he\u2019s so fussy and I just burst into tears. I\u2019m so tired. I want out.

Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.\n\nTruth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So \"give in\" if you want to help yourself.\n\nEDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. \n\nTalking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.\n\n But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever.",

I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.

You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally.\n\nAnd so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what it's like to be depressed.",

Im obviously not qualified to do so , I made this post in tears after listening to him because he has the exact same mentality as I did and still do, and I am extremely depressed myself so I was pretty much hysterical.\n\nEdit 2: I didnt expect this to garner so much attention , thank you to everyone who also understands what im talking about and shared advice or their personal experience.

I got shit done, I was moving, I was working good and as much as I'm scared to actually say it, it was a good day at work.  5 o'clock hits and the INSTANT I walk out that door, it all comes crashing down.  The 25 minute drive home was spent staring blankly ahead of me and I barely remembered the drive once I pulled in my driveway.  And once my ass hit the couch it was like fuckin game over.  I just plummet into this godawful mood like I want to fucking die and wished a semi had hit ice and flattened me earlier.  Intrusive, irrational, disgusting thoughts running buck-fuckin-wild with no control.  and the instant those are \"appeased\", all that energy turns into self-loathing.  I never spend time in my bedroom unless it's to sleep.  But I went to lay in bed and I just wanted to cry.  Me.  Who went 6 years without a single fucking tear and only cried earlier this year cause I got absolutely fucking shitfaced on alcohol and weed.

(17f) This is long and I feel like I\u2019m attention seeking for even writing this, but it\u2019s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I\u2019m tired and don\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nEveryone in my life seems to think that just because they don\u2019t see me crying 24/7, I\u2019m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. \n\nThankfully, somedays I\u2019m numb and can\u2019t feel anything at all. \n\nMy mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don\u2019t pay any bills and don\u2019t go to work, there\u2019s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn\u2019t agree lol. \n\nI zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I\u2019m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I\u2019m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I\u2019ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they\u2019ll leave me alone, a thought that I\u2019ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can\u2019t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. \n\nMy mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn\u2019t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there\u2019s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can\u2019t, I try to force myself, but I can\u2019t get much done and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can\u2019t complete work on time. I\u2019ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. \n\nI also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have \u201cno friends,\u201d but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I\u2019ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one\u2019s ever cared.\n\nI struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I\u2019ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I\u2019m a coward and would never do it. \n\nI\u2019ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said \u2018fine, but she\u2019d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it\u2019 and that she didn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t just talk to her because we\u2019re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. \n\nI know she was just frustrated, but it\u2019s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn\u2019t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. \n\nIt won\u2019t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current \u201cself harm\u201d which I don\u2019t do often, isn\u2019t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won\u2019t and probably never will. \n\nI feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don\u2019t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don\u2019t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. \n\nAlso, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I\u2019m sorry for bothering you all. I didn\u2019t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I\u2019m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I\u2019m staying strong and am not going to let depression win. I thought about deleting this, but if it helps someone I\u2019ll leave it up :)",

I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I\u2019m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it\u2019s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn\u2019t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)\nI just had a kid and I\u2019m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. I have been seeing him everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don\u2019t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn\u2019t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don\u2019t even know how to end this I just don\u2019t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don\u2019t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that\u2019s cuz he wanted what\u2019s best for us and what dad isn\u2019t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn\u2019t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I\u2019m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I\u2019m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if I can take him out to a couple places today.\n\nI said no. I\u2019m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means \u201c5 places that I\u2019ll spend an hour each in\u201d. \n\nI said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he\u2019s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. \n\nOver the word no.\n\nHe eventually said nevermind and a second later he\u2019s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out.\n\nOver the word no.\n\nBut when I tell my parents this, *im* the wrong one for getting *him* upset and not succumbing to what *he* wants. \n\nMy dad asked me the other day if I still had my \u201cdepression\u201d\n\nWhat the fuck does he think?\n\nEdit: thank you for all the solidarity. I oftentimes feel like I\u2019m an asshole and run myself into circles wondering what I did wrong in each and every moment, how I could have prevented a negative confrontation from my family by simply being agreeable with them. I struggle with this and the friends I have don\u2019t always fully understand where I\u2019m coming from all of the time so it\u2019s nice seeing that I\u2019m not insane over denying someone else. I managed to get a go ahead from a friend to stay at his place for the weekend to cool off because I\u2019m starting to spiral and am quickly heading to a place I don\u2019t want to be.

When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. \n\n\nI seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.\n\n\nIt's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. \n  \n\nI know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing. I have avoided them for about 5 years because of this.

No friends, family isn't available. \n\nNight is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. \n\n\nNone of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. \n\n\nI can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger.   \n\nThe kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. \n\n\nThere world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup.\n\n\nI'm so alone. If anyone at all could just talk to me please. Even to just say hi I just need someone to talk to. I no longer have anyone to talk to about my day. \n\nI'm sure no one will read this as it fades into the abyss of /r/depression but its worth a shot. \n\nEDIT: She is alive and at the hospital in stable condition.",

At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.\n\nNext I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.\n\nNext I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.\n\nNext I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. \n\nI'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.\n\nI'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.\n\n\nPS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain \"myself\" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through \"losing\" parts of themselves. Let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. And for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning :)",

The success I've finally found doesn't make me feel anything. I still feel like an empty shell. My brain just doesn't register any positive emotions, only negative ones. I have zero motivation to live when there is no emotional reward for good experiences.\n\n I broke up with the girl I was dating, because even though I cared about her, and on some level I knew it was good to have someone in my life who cared about me, I seemed unable to experience feelings of being in love.

I graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. I'm posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice.\n\nI was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me.  My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself.  I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i  cant believe i let this happened.\n\nI Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college.  I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy.  I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life.\n\nEdit. I never thought my post would get this much attention. I watched a youtube about suicidal thoughts and the guy said reddit helped him so i thought i would give this a try.I thank you all for the comments",

In the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad, I successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia I feel it\u2019s really hard for me to keep going, especially when I compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates, I feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study, I like it but it\u2019s all because of my family wanted it, not me. I then realized that I haven\u2019t done anything for my own good, I just fulfill other people\u2019s wish all the time, this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless. So I\u2019m being suicidal for some months. I talked to my mom last month, I said if I could quit, because I want to restart my own life and try to enjoy. I know I mess up my 31 year long life already since I don\u2019t have a goal I am just being alive as my parents\u2019 best obedient kid, I see no future, no meaning in my life so I want to give up, I feel so excited when thinking about death, a relief and a method to solve all the pains. \nI talked about these feelings with my mom and dad I hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no, I can\u2019t quit before I finish my school, also they said if I want to die, it\u2019s better to finish my school first then I can die with a certificate, that at least makes them feel good that I did a thing.  \n\nI really want to die as a revenge to them, they don\u2019t care about me and my problem, they said if I die it\u2019ll be a huge loss and shame for them, because their peers would really look down to them. But now they seem to know that my depression isn\u2019t a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me, they literally said that I can kill myself if I could at least get the certificate, I really let them down all the time they said if I could try at least once?\n\nI have no friends no relationship no one I could talk to with my problems but I don\u2019t think anything will help me out. I\u2019m just super suicidal I cry all day, I want to end everything but I hate my mom\u2019s sad face and crying.",

His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. \n\nWe have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him \"Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up.\" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. \n\nHe's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. \n\nMy brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.\n\nI also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. \n\nWhat do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?",

If you google \"reasons to live\" they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones. I have very little loved ones, and I cant express enough how little I give a shit about how sad they're gonna be when I kill myself. There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that. Because I will have victory for once, I will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and I'm glad. Their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead. \n\nI do not enjoy living, as I have stated in other posts. I dont care about the little things in life. The smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live, you jackass. I may laugh at things that are funny, and may enjoy making others laugh, and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend, but it just isnt enough. I need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide, I am not fucking willing to put in any hard work, because I could just kill myself lol. I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. \n\nBut no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter. I feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me, whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because I know that one day I wont have to deal with this shit because I'll be dead and buried.",

    "postText": "Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free. After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.\n\nAnd I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. \n\nSorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted. As hard as it is to believe sometimes, we all deserve to feel that way. Today was as hard as any other day, but I know somewhere I have the capacity to feel better. We all do. ",

    "postText": "43 and completely lost I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   \n\nI've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  \n\nI'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. \nI can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.\nI don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  \n\nI've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.  \n\nThanks for reading all this.  I love you.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m kinda disgusted with myself I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that\u2019s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don\u2019t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I\u2019ve always spent my life in clutter. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at TV show level but it\u2019s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I\u2019ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.\n\n\nI remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d For \u201ccome in\u201d I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess \u201cI just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I\u2019ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted\u201d I know she didn\u2019t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I\u2019d handle it. I never really did.\n\n\nI can handle living in clutter. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He\u2019s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn\u2019t deserve this life. Like I said we\u2019ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there\u2019s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He\u2019s one of the only things that keep me going because I\u2019m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don\u2019t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we\u2019d pull up in the car he\u2019d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn\u2019t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can\u2019t let him keep living like this. \n\n\nI\u2019m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I\u2019ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.\n\n\nEdit: wow I did not expect to get such a huge response. I basically passed out on my bed right after posting this  but I only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment. Also a big thanks for the awards. It\u2019s been a difficult path, I\u2019ve been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like I haven\u2019t made so much as a dent in the mess but I appreciate the kind words and motivation. I\u2019ll be reading through the comments and try to respond to as many as I possibly can",

    "postText": "The cancer has spread to my liver Well it's most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there's a chance it'll be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again.\n\nIm just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel.\n\nForgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways.\n\nEdit: I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock. You all are so nice and lovely...it definitely helps the ol psyche when so many people affirm that I'm allowed to be upset. So thank you, to everyone who has commented or upvoted, these little moments of support help so much sometimes. Thank you.",

The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out.\n\nLong story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health.\n\nI spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that\u2019s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don\u2019t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. \n\nI don\u2019t know what that is yet but I\u2019m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it\u2019s all remote. \n\nRight now I don\u2019t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren\u2019t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I\u2019ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite.\n\nNow I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me \u201cjust wait, your time will come\u201d and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just \u201cyour life sucks, you can\u2019t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better\u201d\n\nWell what if it doesn\u2019t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it\u2019s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job\n\nI don\u2019t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It\u2019s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. \n\nAm I being a freak or what? Why can\u2019t I just catch a fucking break?\n\nEdit: you guys are really sweet and this made my day, thank you",

Hi I\u2019m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I\u2019m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I\u2019ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.\n\nI\u2019ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn\u2019t thought I could find, I\u2019ve managed to use the city\u2019s train to travel, didn\u2019t think I could do that. I\u2019ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I\u2019ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I\u2019ve done it every time anyway!\n\nI\u2019ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven\u2019t found anyone, and I\u2019ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it\u2019s so pretty and I just feel so free!\n\nI lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it\u2019s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room \u201cwow, just wow. Wow!!!\u201d And freaked out cause I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!\n\nI ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I\u2019m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a \u201csocial break\u201d to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)\n\nNow I\u2019m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)\n\nThe clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don\u2019t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I\u2019m taking care of myself)\n\nThis is more progress I\u2019ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I\u2019ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.\n\nI\u2019m so proud of myself!\n\nFeels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I\u2019m imaging how awesome this trip would\u2019ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I\u2019m gay)\n\nI\u2019m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I\u2019m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can\u2019t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!\n\nI know this sounds cringe and I can\u2019t believe Ive done this. I\u2019m so confused why I don\u2019t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn\u2019t that scary, when u have small \u201cmissions\u201d all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I\u2019m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.\n\nI know that when I get home tomorrow, it\u2019s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven\u2019t had this much fun in sooo many years!\n\nI feel alive.\n\n// Anton",

Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. \"What's the big deal?\" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of \"treating myself\" to anything \"just because\" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. \n\n\nSo now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.\n\n\nEDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol.

Whenever I try talking with a friend I just clam up. I don't understand myself. I don't understand why I am like this. Why can't I just express how I'm feeling. Maybe because expressing feelings aloud makes them real or permanent. A perspective voiced gives permenamce to those thoughts. I'm still unsure of anything and everything.",

She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.\nShe had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.\nIn the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.\nDuring my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.\nI demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.\nWhen she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.\nMy daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.\nI have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.\nI am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness.",

I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.\n\nI literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to spend more money on experiences.\nI didn\u2019t need to pretend I wasn\u2019t upset.\n\nI just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.\n\nMy family rarely thanks me for things. They don\u2019t care unless I\u2019m in crisis or isolating. I\u2019ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn\u2019t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can\u2019t be bothered to hear me.\n\nI am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.\n\n\nFeelings don\u2019t go away because you\u2019re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn\u2019t react.\n\nI am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I\u2019m part of this family too.\n\nTL;DR depression reared it\u2019s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...\n\nEdit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn\u2019t really expect this but if you\u2019re a depressed empathy like me\nI know it\u2019s hard and I know it\u2019s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions.

Just like the title says I am 58 M.\nI visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. \nWhile reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......\nLost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.\nThe issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. \nSo, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.\nBUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. \nOk, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.\nHave a good day.

Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives. I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what \"constructive discharge\" means that is what seems to be happening at work.\n\nSo anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.\n\nI really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.\n\nI gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.\n\nthanks",

It's gotten to the point where I feel like suicide is my destiny, because it's the only future outcome for myself I've ever envisioned.\n\nI feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night.\n\nEvery time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year.  \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the overwhelming response of kindness and support from this community. I wasn't expecting it, and it made my day. It seems like the general consensus is that I should get another cat, and I agree. It's something I'm looking into, and I'll be sure to update when I get a second furry friend. ",

In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be \"no big deal\" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.\n\nSorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of. But I will always keep trying.",

    "postText": "No one showed. I should have expected that. I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.\n\nEarlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.\n\nShe decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. \n\nThen the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. \n\nWe got various excuses throughout the night. \"I got sick\", \"Stuff has come up\", \"car isn't starting\", \"No babysitters\", \"My boss just called me in\". \n\nMy wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). \n\nI don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, \"Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative.\" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. \n\nIf I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.\n\nEdit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit.",

I have to then put all of these tasks on my habit tracker to create an incentive to do all of these things, and manufacture motivation by seeing the \"streak\" that I have maintained. I somehow then muster the energy over the span of weeks to reach a functional state where I am fairly productive. Then automatically, or by virtue of some trigger, my passively suicidal thought become intense, I become exhausted and the cycle repeats.

When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.\n\nMy depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.\n\n\"What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?\"\n\nThis is shit I do not need running through my mind.\n\nTwo years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.\n\nSo, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.\n\nI got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.\n\nLater that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...\n\n\"What if I just went up there and--\"\n\nThen it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?\n\nI did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.\n\nI've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.\n\nIt's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.\n\n-=-=-\n\n(also posted in /r/getting_over_it, if it's not allowed to post in two subs, let me know and I'll delete.)",

However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.\n\nI would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.\n\nat that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. \n\nmy teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a \"disappointment\" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. \n\ni would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to \"punish\" myself. \n\nto make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. \n\nthis was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this.",

We are already struggling so bad and I\u2019m unable to work due to how rough this pregnancy is. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to afford rent in a few days now. And we\u2019re both so hungry. All we have to eat is some canned diced tomatoes we\u2019ve had for awhile now. And i can\u2019t stand tomatoes but I\u2019m so hungry. I might try to walk to the panera bread next door later and see if they have and leftover food or something before they close. I also went to the doctor yesterday for blood work and they called earlier to tell me that I\u2019m significantly anemic and have to start taking medicine that i can\u2019t afford right now and insurance doesn\u2019t cover. Its also about to go into the negatives where i live and all my apartment has is a tiny space heater. Everything is just gone so wrong so quickly. 6 months ago everything was perfect. And now i haven\u2019t ate in days and can\u2019t afford toilet paper. I\u2019ve attempted to take my life before but this time ill get it right. If i don\u2019t then my boyfriend has to deal with the consequences. If i die life could be so much easier for him. He could probably move back in with his dad and get a job. He wouldn\u2019t have to go hungry. I wanted this baby so bad but how could i bring her into a world when i can\u2019t take care of her. I considered adoption but my boyfriend loves this baby so so much already and he would never let that happen. She\u2019s just a baby so she doesn\u2019t know anything yet so i think it would be better now. I absolutely hate that im going to do this to her but we haven\u2019t ate in days and she\u2019s probably so hungry. At least we can go together and wont be alone. Maybe my mom or grandparents will have some kind of sympathy and pay for our funeral expenses. I don\u2019t know how that stuff works but maybe they\u2019ll cut her out of me and put her in the casket with me and maybe hold her. I\u2019ll leave a note about it maybe. If you believe in prayers please pray for us. This is the most selfish thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nUpdate. I\u2019m taking with some really nice people that are helping me mentally. I appreciate all the messages and support. It means so much really. And as much as I appreciate it please don\u2019t message me offering me money. As much as it would help and as much as i would honestly love to take it i cant. I didn\u2019t post this wanting anyones money. I honestly don\u2019t know why i posted this. I guess i just wanted someone to listen to me. \nAs many good and supportive messages I\u2019ve got I\u2019ve received alot of negative ones as well. And as much as i wish the good could outweigh the bad right now it can\u2019t. Reading all the hurtful comments and messages somehow makes everything more sucky than it already is. I posted in another sub before this one and they aren\u2019t even close to as caring and supportive as you all are. There\u2019s a big concern about how i got a tattoo a few months ago while i was pregnant and how i had the money for it. And honestly i didn\u2019t know i was pregnant at the time of getting the tattoo and i was financially stable at the time and could afford it. And at  But i would easily take it all back now if i could. And at the time of me getting pregnant me and my boyfriend was expecting it. We really wanted a baby and we was doing good in life so we never expected things to go wrong so quickly. I wouldn\u2019t call me getting pregnant irresponsible as some are saying. We just really wanted our baby and thought we could do it. And there was more confusion about how I referred to my boyfriend as my husband in previous post. And no we\u2019re not married but engaged and like to think of ourselves as married and call each other husband and wife alot. Its just a little cute thing we do with each other.\nI\u2019m going to pick up some groceries in the morning that a really nice lady on here ordered for me. She\u2019s literally the sweetest. She odered me some prenatals and some cat food as well just in case but i have enough for awhile now. my boyfriend is going to try to get a temp job at a company we both worked for together a little over a year ago. It wont pay the best but they pay quickly and weekly so maybe we can cover rent in a few days.\nI don\u2019t wanna say i over reacted to everything i said earlier because even now I\u2019m still feeling All the same feelings i was hours ago and am still in a bad place. But  there\u2019s a little bit of hope now that things can get better. I really really hope so. Thank you all again. I\u2019m sorry if this all comes off as me rambling. I\u2019m just still not thinking the most clearly.\n\nI ended up deleting my other post in a different sub suggested from people here. The hate on that sub was becoming very overwhelming.",

Or that I was self deprecating all day. Or because I spoke/acted on impulse and suffered the consequences. While I still have very bad anxiety, my medication has started effectively dampening it. I\u2019ve also started having fewer ideations in general, and I\u2019ve been trying my hardest for the first time in my life to help myself get better. I stopped drinking almost completely (I sometimes have one/month), when my friends do illicit activities I opt out, I\u2019ve taken away specific triggers, I\u2019ve found a way to hold myself to a flexible eating schedule. But I\u2019m noticing that by doing all of these \u201cgood\u201d things I am starting to feel worse, because despite everything I am still depressed.

Literally expressionless, but tears running down my face.\n\nI don't even know how to explain my sadness. Someone will ask how they can help, and I literally have no idea. It's not even like I have negative thought patterns, I think pretty positively. But there's just like this small demon scratching the back of the deepest parts of my brain, slowly clawing away. Now there's nothing left. I have no emotion, but somehow too much emotion. Every second, I feel like exploding, but I literally can't, I've become so, so numb that I can't release my emotions. They are trapped forever, and I can't find the key to open them.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? Like you can't explain how you feel to people, so it's impossible for people to help you?

Seeing things in hindsight makes you feel dumb, but the real truth is that back then nobody saw it coming. Only few, very few people really believed in BTC as a store of value or whatever. If you could go back in time and told people in 2010 that in 2021 hedge funds, S&P500 companies and even insurance companies are buying billions worth of BTC at 40k+ USD and using it as a store of value, everybody would just see you as the tin-foil hat person, laugh at you and call you mad and delusional.\n\nThis is the reason why I generally feel bad for those \"two pizzas are now worth X millions\" posts, as if the people who traded BTC for goods in the old days could predict the future. As such, the moment your holdings were at 10x your initial investment, very, very likely you would have sold as well, or just bought that awesome thing you could suddenly acquire with magic internet money.\n\nThat being said, do not punish yourself with the \"if I had\" thinking.

    "postText": "I made a post about the scam OpisHub yesterday. The scammers didn't like that and bought downvotes to make my post invisible. So this is an even more detailed post about them. Yesterday I made [a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6zy0e/scam_warning_if_you_see_posts_praising_opishub_on/) about OpisHub. It's still up, but the main point was that they approached me to shill their shitcoin for money and that they are really shady, it has many red flags and very much looks like a scam.\n\nThen one of the scammers (Scammer 2) sent me a message that he didn't like it, and that I was deleting his comments on my post (lol he has less than 50 comment karma, they just got deleted, of course I didn't do anything). My post only had like 35 or 50 upvotes at this point and it had already been 2 hours since I posted, the post wouldn't have become very big - but the scammers decided to buy downvotes, bringing it to below 0 within minutes, [see also here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o75scd/the_scammers_behind_opishub_didnt_like_the_post_i/h2wxc7e/). The mods deleted a post about this that I made yesterday (because it broke another rule, so I understand - but that post is probably also the reason why my original post is above 0 again), so here I go again: these guys are obviously shady, some examples:\n\n* one of them (the one that originally approached me, Scammer 1), [pretended to have just stumbled across the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) instead of saying that he was part of the project **EDIT:** just saw that the post was deleted, it's archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/)\n* they wanted to pay me (and most likely others) to shill their project\n* they [openly told me](https://imgur.com/a/rgw1HsB) they would do vote manipulation and upvote my posts about them and then, well, bought downvotes\n\nSo even if the coin would not be a total scam - which I really think it is - they are obviously doing shady stuff. I have already listed the obvious red flags that make them look like your average scam coin, here they are again, slightly adapted:\n\n* they use your phone's CPU for mining\n* the CPU is used to power scientific research (of course they don't say what \"scientific research\" they are talking about anywhere). And I work in science: of course I would rather use the CPU of a few phones than, well, the powerful computers we have, just as much as I would rather ride a few cats that are tied together than a horse\n* \"each transaction gives a small % to charity\"\n* they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees\n* \"our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get  their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place\", so it's officially a pyramid scheme\n* the token (and app) will launch soon \u2122\n\nScammer 1 had also told me they \"have received \u00a33.5million pounds in the last week to utilise to get this project off the ground\". If you look at their social media activity etc., it's all extremely basic and unprofessional (but check out their Twitter, it's kind of funny - they really try to seem \"sciency\" but don't really know anything about science I think. The followers are either also bought or baited by some fake giveaways, very few seem to be normal, non-spammy accounts) - no company with multiple millions funding would present themselves like that. Also look at the [start of the email](https://imgur.com/a/tbq5YZ9) they sent me in beautiful red, Scammer 1 didn't even remove the \"initial contact\", which I think is hilarious.\n\nSo again, if you see positive posts about this project, it's either the scammers or people with less morals that they approached. Stay away from them as far as possible, at least don't give them money, your personal information, or go to their website/ download their app so they can send you viruses.",

    "postText": "Not every new coin is a shitcoin: How to spot the real GEMS inside the sea of shitcoins. A few days ago, I made a post titled *\"Rugpulls and Honeypots. What they are and how you can avoid them.\"* Since then I got a lot of messages from people asking me how they can tell the difference between a new coin with lots of potential and a shitcoin. For maximum protection, make sure you follow this guide in combination with the other guide. I will not repeat those rules here. If you don't follow the rules of the other guide as well, you will lose your money.\n\nBefore I start, some background: I trade small coins for a living. In the beginning, while learning, I fell for all the scams just like everyone else. But with every loss I learned something new and I'm now pretty good at it. Yes, I have losses like everyone else, but usually I get out with very small losses compared to my gains.\n\nAnyone here hating shitcoins, I agree with you. **I hate shitcoins too.** Part of what I want to explain here however is that not every new coin is a shitcoin. Every coin has to start with 0 holders. Everyone has to start somewhere. And every solid project deserves a chance to grow. Yes, the vast majority of new coins are shitcoins, but I want to help you tell the difference between the real gems and all the shitcoins.\n\n# The Golden Rules\n\nIf you start looking for the real gems and want to trade smaller coins, **follow these rules or you will lose money**. \n\n1. Start trading on the BSC (Binance) Smart Chain. Why? Transactions cost around $0.20 max. You can't do this on the ETH chain where you spend lots on gas fees, sorry. I know they came down, but they're still too high.\n2. For the first 1-2 months, don't invest more than $5 per coin. I am not joking. Yes, your gains will not be thousands of dollars, but if you go in with more you will end up losing a lot of money, trust me.\n3. Have a small bag of maybe $150 or $200. Be prepared to lose your small bag completely. If you can't afford this and sleep well at night, don't do it.\n\n**Ready? Let's start:**\n\n# Find the Coins\n\nGo to the BscScan website (look up the links yourself, I don't want to link-spam this post). Then, go to \"View BEP-20 Transfers\". If the list looks confusing, don't worry. Look at the rightmost column that says \"Tokens\". You must look for the grey icon besides the coin names. Why? Because that means the coin is new. Established coins already have their icons listed and that means you're usually too late to make high gains. You can refresh that page for new coins every second, you will always find new ones.\n\nOpen the new coins (with the grey icon) in separate tabs and look at them. So, now you have found a coin, it's time to investigate.\n\n# 1. Holders\n\nOn the page you just opened, look at the \"Holders\" list. The biggest holders of a coin should always be the liquidity pool which is usually identified as \"PancakeSwap: COIN NAME\" and the dead coins wallet, usually identified as \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead\". Why is this important? It reduces the possibility of a rugpull to almost zero, especially if the dead coins wallet is over 50%.\n\nAlso watch out if there are too many whales. For example, 10 wallets each holding 3% of total coins is a huge red flag. Abort immediately. A healthy new coin should also have at least 200-300 holders. If it doesn't, also abort immediately.\n\n# 2. Liquidity Pool\n\nThe liquidity pool is super important. I usually don't buy any new coin unless the liquidity pool is at least $30k or more. Why? Because scammers and shitcoins rarely provide a liquidity pool of that size. Again, we're greatly reducing our risks here. A locked liquidity pool is also important. Make sure it's locked for a longer period of time. 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or longer are great. You don't want the liquidity pool to unlock tomorrow. You can copy the contract ID and then go to \"PooCoin\" (again, look up the links yourself), then enter the contract URL there, hit enter and on the next page on the left side it will show you something like \"COIN/BNB LP BNB Holdings:\". That's where you want at least $30k or more. If it has a few hundred dollars or even only $5k or $7k, abort immediately.\n\n# 3. Volume\n\nLook at the \"Transfers\" section. If the coin has only 5 holders and no activity, skip it. If you want, bookmark it and come back to check tomorrow. You may have just been too early. If it has only a few transactions every 2-3 hours, also abort immediately. It's not taking off yet. A good number of transactions for a new coin should be about 5-10 per minute.\n\n# 4. Website & Twitter\n\nMake sure the coin has a website and twitter account. If it doesn't have both of them, abort immediately. If it also has a reddit page, a Telegram channel, a Discord, an Instagram page, a YouTube channel, etc. that's even better.\n\n# 5. Coin Name & Design\n\nThe logo of the coin and the design of the graphics and website are very important. If it's not attractive, people will not jump in and it won't take off. If the use stock images that you've seen a hundred times elsewhere, abort immediately. The name is also super important. If it has a catchy name like \"Save The World\" it's much more likely to take off than \"Funky Toilet Coin 55\".\n\n# 6. Bonus: Doxxed Team\n\nThis one is a HUGE bonus. If the team members publicly identify themselves, for example through YouTube videos or live AMA, it reduces the chance of a scam to almost zero. Why? Because their faces and identities are publicly known and they would almost certainly end up in prison.\n\n# That's it!\n\nDid the coin you investigated fail in any of the first 5 steps? I cannot stress this enough, but: ABORT IMMEDIATELY. Don't invest in it. You will end up losing your money.\n\nDid the coin pass all of the above steps? Great! You ***might*** have found a gem. Do some more research before you jump in and make sure the coin has a real purpose. Remember, things like hodling to get more coins or \"to the moon!\" are not real purposes.\n\nAnd now we go back to the golden rules. If you are ready to invest in this coin, **remember to only invest $5 for the first 1-2 months** of doing this. I cannot stress this enough. You are learning and you will make mistakes. Make sure you are okay with losing that money because even if a coin matches all of the above, it can still fail for a variety of reasons. If you stick to this rule, you can still make a good amount of money in these 1-2 months. I easily made $10 to $50 with just $5. Sometimes I got out at $3.50 because a coin didn't take off and re-invested elsewhere.\n\nOnce you've done the above for 1-2 months and you've noticed any potential mistakes you made, you should be ready to start trading with $10 or $20 per coin (depending on your financial situation).\n\nTwo more important things to remember:\n\n1. Early coins take time to take off. It's very possible that your $5 investment will drop to $3 or $2 in that time and go up to $10 and then go back down to $4. It may just sit there doing nothing for 5-14 days. That's absolutely normal.\n2. Keep track of what the team is doing during this time. If there are no updates for 2-3 days, sell and get out. A good team should update its holders several times per day through several channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc). It's okay to get only 1 update per day, but less than that is a red flag.\n\nI **always** follow the above rules when trading with small coins and I currently have success with 90-95% of coins that I invest in. Trust me, **I tried to skip some of the rules above and I got burned every time**. Yes, it's a lot of work. Especially if you have to repeat these steps for every single coin you want to investigate, but you will get much faster at it over time. If you end up doing this for a living, you will probably be able to investigate 2-3 coins per minute.\n\nNow, if you excuse me, I need a coffee and relax my fingers a bit. They hurt :P",

    "postText": "Wall Street has decided you're not responsible enough to buy GME. This is why we need DeFi. For years, the crypto community has pointed to government control over fiat money as the reason Bitcoin needs to exist. People need an asset that they know can't be arbitrarily printed or controlled by corrupt governments.\n\nAnd after 12 years, this narrative is taking hold. The financial industry is starting to take Bitcoin seriously, investors and large corporations are putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet to reduce their dependency on the behavior of the US federal government.\n\n**But the next fight is upon us.**\n\nThis week, the common folk of the internet discovered their power. They discovered that by working together, they can challenge the powerful entities of Wall Street.\n\nAnd Wall Street hates it.\n\nAs of right now, Robinhood and most other trading products are in \"reduce only mode\".\n\nWall Street has decided that you're not responsible enough to buy the stocks that you like, so they've taken away your stock buying privileges.\n\nOf course, hedge funds will still have access to GME and AMC. But not you.\n\n**This is why Bitcoin is only the beginning of this revolution.**\n\nIt's not simply enough to be able to custody your own assets. You need to be able to trade them, to lend them, to leverage them. You should have access to the same financial instruments that the rich people on Wall Street have access to.\n\n**This is why we need DeFi**\n\nNobody can turn off Uniswap. Nobody can turn off Aave. Nobody can turn off Synthetix.\n\nNobody can tell you that leverage-longing some shitcoin is irresponsible and you're not allowed to do it.\n\n**This can be our moment.**\n\nThousands of people, from WSB to Twitter, have just been deplatformed, just for wanting to invest their money as they see fit.\n\nLet's show them the future. Let's show them a world where finance is not owned by any government or hedge fund or billionaire.\n\nA world where, as long as you're not hurting anyone, you're free to use your money however you like.",

    "postText": "I will tell you exactly what is going on here, this is critical information to understand if you are going to make money in this space. How prices work, and what moves them - and it's not money invested/withdrawn. /edit: Hi /r/all. While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. \n\nPlease consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)\n\n[Bored for a night? Go watch \"Sustainable\" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) \n\nLook into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. \n\nWant to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.\n\nIf everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.\n\nWhile you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.\n\nYou can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.\n\nDo it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nOriginal post starts below. I apologize for the shilling of Permaculture, but I think loss of topsoil will impact us all if we don't reverse it soon. We need soil, we need bees, we need food. We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n**I also expended the \"now what happens\" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**\n\nI've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. \n\n... and Humans are an emotional bunch.\n\nSo what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?\n\n**AN EXAMPLE**\n\nThis is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....\n\nThis is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)\n\nLets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.\n\nSo, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.\n\nOkay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.\n\nNews comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe \"this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing\".\n\nSuddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. \n\nAt the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up \"just incase it moons\") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. \n\nThe other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. \n\nThe sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. \n\nThe price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still \"worth\" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. \n\nThe $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides \"he's out\" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.\n\nThe latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.\n\nThis is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.\n\n**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**\n\nNow the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.\n\nIf 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.\n\nNote, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). \n\n**So now what happens?**\n\nTime goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.\n\nAlso, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. \n\nSo what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. \n\nPeople who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. \n\n**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. \n\n**Moving forward**\n\nNow news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. \n\nThe people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.\n\nSellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. \n\nJunk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. \n\nMoney is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.\n\n\n**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**\n\nA lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.\n\nThese new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were \"ground floor adopters\" and were going to get rich.\n\nThey outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.\n\nTo keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of \"new money\" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. \n\nTheir opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.\n\nThese people then started hearing \"Bubble\", \"Scam\", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. \n\n**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**\n\nMost investment opportunities go first to \"accredited investors\". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in \"early\", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. \n\nNot only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track \"monetary value\" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?\n\nBut they have woken up now. This thing has \"popped\" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.\n\nThey have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.\n\nYOUR OPINION OF IT.\n\nAnd they know it.\n\n**Media.**\n\nThat's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about \"what are the motives of the person saying this to me\". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? \n\nWhat about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to \"protect\" customers from \"unsafe investments\" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.\n\nJust understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. \n\nSo, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.\n\nWithout a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.\n\nTLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).\n\nSomething is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.\n\n[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. \n\nEvery day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:\n\nHave those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? \n\nWhat are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? \n\nWhat about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?\n\nThese are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.\n\nHappy investing everyone.\n\n/EDIT: some have asked to donate some crypto.

Even if that's true, there are plenty of nicer ways to say it and we don't need to be driving away newbies who will ultimately help grow the market.

Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. **We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them.**\n\n\n\n\n\nOther sources:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/tesla-invests-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin-plans-to-accept-cryptocurrency\n\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/",

    "postText": "Pornhub just saved a lot of my crypto So about 20 minutes ago, I got a \"hey, did you fly to Germany overnight?\" Unauthorized login email from pornhub. Checked it, sure enough someone logged in with my password. Don't give two shits about someone watching porn on my account, so I immediately went to work on the rest.\n\nI don't share passwords with any accounts, but pornhub one was an oddly secure password that probably couldn't be brute forced... I assumed breach.\n\nChanged all my exchange passwords that were tied to the same email, and switched all their 2fa to my phone instead of email. That's when I start getting login failure notices... Of course they hit the exchanges first.\n\nAfter that I damage controlled financial institution accounts, and sure enough started seeing login failures on those. About 15 minutes after I got the pornhub notice (when serious damage would've already been done) I got a \"possible breach\" notification from capital one assistant.\n\nI totally am usually asleep right now. Pornhub may have just saved me tens of thousands of dollars, and is apparently more reliable than all my financial institutions.\n\n****Update and FAQ:\n\nThanks so much for the awards and responses! I just thought this was a funny near miss and wanted to share my maniacal laughter, had no idea it would blow up like this.\n\nSo, turns out it was my phone that was malware compromised. Factory reset, extended authy to everything for now, all passwords changed, all financial institutions alerted.\n\nAs has been pointed out a few times in comments, it's likely they accessed pornhub first because if I had linked crypto wallets or bank accounts for tipping, they could just send all meh money to their verified account. Probably a super easy front door way of scooping a couple BTC up from unwitting peoples... Hadn't thought of that, I just assumed they were testing access.\n\nNo, having a pornhub account doesn't mean I pay for porn, just that I like to save playlists and favorites. Some of you are living in the 90s of internet porn. \n\nAmazed at how many people assume that the breach came from pornhub. Frankly, it seems like they guard info better than anyone else I deal with. I would never think of putting personal information into any porn site... Pornhub's app has always proven to be secure and well supported.\n\nAll credit accounts frozen, all financial institutions contacted. Net loss of ZERO. They attempted a $7000 wire transfer out of my checking account that my small town bank ofc called me about, and a $1300 credit card purchase that got declined as sketch. Otherwise it seems I beat them to all accounts.\n\n****EDIT 2:\n\nSince so many people are asking about my phone... It's an Android, brand new Motorola sealed in box. No, I don't know the source, just know that it happened in a 2 hour window before I got all my security up and running, during which time I used it for work a lot and downloaded a lot of my standard programs.\n\nI just ran my basic security check, and thing came up red af, so I didn't even bother trying to treat... I only have had it for a week, reset was easy.",

We have been dreaming about mass adoption and decentralization. We wondered what it would be like. We have been asking ourselves that question since 2016 and possibly even earlier. Well...\n\nHere is your answer. This is how the market looks like when we start to see a tiny bit of mass adoption.\n\nBillionaires are manipulating the market? It's a part of the mass adoption game we have to accept. There are ways to resist it, but you can't just say \"Please Elton go home and shut up\" because guess what, Elton won't go home and shut up. \n\nYou can't ban anyone from coming into this space, that's the whole point of fucking decentralization. You can't ban a billionaire from participating in the same way you can't ban a school teacher from participating.\n\nYou want to complain about people buying doggy coins? Same shit. Tough luck that your coin is only seeing 1000% growth and not 10,000% boo. Again, you can resist your FOMO and you can invest smartly into fundamentals, but you cannot ban people from spending their money. It's their money and you're not HSBC. No matter how much you wish for it, you can't ban people from buying Bitconnect or Cumdoggy coins or whatever, they'll learn from their experience and that's how the market will correct it self.\n\nRejoice crypto hodlers. \n\nThe days we have been dreaming about have arrived.\n\nDon't be a bunch of salties.",

You can't make this up. **What are the Pandora Papers ?**\n\n\"**The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents that reveals hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful.**\n\nMore than 600 journalists in 117 countries have been trawling through the files from 14 sources for months, finding stories that are being published this week.\n\nThe data was obtained by the **International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)** in Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation.\n\n**What has been uncovered?**\n\nThe Pandora Papers leak includes 6.4 million documents, almost three million images, more than a million emails and almost half-a-million spreadsheets.\n\nStories revealed so far include:\n\n* **the owners of more than 1,500 UK properties bought using offshore firms**, including individuals accused of corruption\n* the Qatari ruling family who **avoided \u00a318.5m tax on a London super-mansion**\n* **Sir Philip and Lady Green went on a property spree** after off-loading the BHS retail chain which went on to collapse\n* the prominent Tory donor who was **involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals**\n* **the King of Jordan's \u00a370m spending spree** on properties in the UK and US through secretly-owned companies\n* Azerbaijan's leading family's **hidden involvement in property deals in the UK worth more than \u00a3400m**\n* the Czech prime minister's **failure to declare an offshore investment company** used to purchase two French villas for \u00a312m\n* how the family of Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta's **secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades**\n\nThe files expose how some of the most powerful people in the world - **including more than 330 politicians from 90 countries** \\- use secret offshore companies to hide their wealth.\"\n\n(Source: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-58780561](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-58780561))\n\n\"The leak shows that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, singer Shakira and many other familiar faces engaged in, at best, aggressive tax avoidance that was accomplished by hiding assets in extremely complex corporate legal entities. Though in some cases hidden funds seem linked to outright corruption, much of this activity is nominally legal \u2013 but the very existence of such structures almost guarantees they\u2019re being used for deeply harmful ends well beyond dodging taxes.\n\nFor those in the crypto world, it is tempting to frame these revelations in terms of simple \u201cwhataboutism.\u201d And hooboy, what about this: By one estimate, as much as **$32 trillion in assets worldwide** **may be in offshore tax havens. That\u2019s roughly** ***15 times the total value of all cryptocurrency in existence***\\*\\*,\\*\\* and much of it amounts to theft by world leaders from their own citizens. The tax revenues missing thanks to those hidden funds mean immense amounts of missing public infrastructure and services worldwide, at the particular expense of the poorest and most vulnerable people.\n\nThere are many nuanced, detailed arguments for the inevitability of cryptocurrency and blockchain\u2019s growth and adoption \u2013 advantages of efficiency, trust, privacy and autonomy that are already proving out at a global scale.\n\nBut interest in cryptocurrency is driven perhaps most of all by something more elemental and emotional, a deep intuition that has been rising around the world for decades: **that the people in charge cannot, and should not, be trusted.\"**\n\n(Source: [https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/the-pandora-papers-show-why-people-love-crypto-you-cant-trust-the-powerful/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/the-pandora-papers-show-why-people-love-crypto-you-cant-trust-the-powerful/))\n\nHillary Clinton recently stated that: \"What looks like a very interesting and somewhat exotic effort to literally mine new coins in order to trade with them **has the potential for undermining currencies, for undermining the role of the dollar as the reserve currency, for destabilizing nations\"** and she is completely right, that is the idea of cryptocurrencies in the 21st century, **to deconstruct a corrupt financial system and provide a more decentralized, better version of it.**\n\n(Source: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/hillary-clinton-says-cryptocurrency-destabilize-nations-2021-11](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/hillary-clinton-says-cryptocurrency-destabilize-nations-2021-11))\n\n**Crypto is a way out, a way to take control of our finances on our way to decentralized financial system.** The people who are supposed to lead us, realize the threat that crypto poses and that we, millions of adopters, have the potential to destabilize nations, central banks and traditional currencies. I think we are in for a hell of ride this decade, and we will hit a lot of resistance once governments start to regulate crypto, but I am surely excited to see where this development will lead us and that I jumped on the train.",

    "postText": "Bill Gates said \u201cThe way cryptocurrency works today allows for certain criminal activities. It\u2019d be good to get rid of that\u201d. Crypto was not used to launder money according to Pandora papers. Its time for these people to swallow their words and be critical of traditional finance and the government. Pandora papers showed that people are using loopholes in tax laws to hide their wealth in tax havens to hide their wealth or ill gotten gains. They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.\n\nThe rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or \"offshore\".\n\nThese offshore countries or territories are where:\n\n\\- it's easy to set up companies\n\n\\- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies\n\n\\- there is low or no corporation tax.\n\nThe best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.\n\nIts estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.\n\nTo hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.\n\nWhen such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.\n\nThis legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.\n\nIts time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 1: It was a mistake on my part to say crypto is not used for money laundering. I saw that Bill Gates mentioned cryptocurrency as an innovation that the world can do without because it is sometimes used for criminal activities and with the current pandora papers leak where the ultra rich was dodging taxes using tax havens and trusts and thought , here is a guy doing borderline unethical things to dodge taxes and is bad mouthing a nascent technology because it is used for criminal activities by a small section of people taking advantage of its use cases. He was saying the world doesn't need crypto without seeing it's far reaching positive sides. \n\n\nI thought if a few criminal activities makes him think that crypto should be stopped, why doesn't he say the same thing about the banks, law firms and other institutions that promote, support and enrich from tax dodging. That's why I made the post.\nI am sorry I made the mistake in the headline, it was unintentional. \n\nI didn't expect the post will blow up or will be seen by more than a couple of people. Sorry again.",

    "postText": "I've retired thanks to crypto, but there's something very few people think about or tell you: boredom hits hard TL;DR: do not stop working/studying when/if you get rich through crypto (or by any other means). Set up your own business, study something you love or whatever. Just make sure your brain will keep doing some exercise and that you'll be part of some group/society.\n\nSeeing so many posts about when lambo, when moon etc., I see myself a few years ago discovering that I could finally hasten by \\~10 years my retirement (I'm in my 60's now). Damn, was I happy about that. I could finally erase all my debt, travel without worrying about days off being discounted of my paycheck, spend lots of time with my family and buy some of the stuff I've always wanted. In \\~6 months my life changed really hard, and for the better! I gave my grand kids a nice trip do Disney and paid the wedding of my youngest daughter. Suddenly everything fit perfectly.\n\nAfter 7-8 months, then, I got myself thinking like \"so... is this it?\". I was not happy anymore. Don't get me wrong: I wasn't *unhappy*, but I wasn't happy either. I would wake up everyday, go for a walk, pass by some bakery and buy some stuff, and get back home to surf on the web. I could of course travel to wherever I wanted, but what for? \n\nFriends came in asking for money and I never heard from them again. Some relatives thought I'd won the lottery and suddenly became extremely friendly and helpful, even though literally no one but my daughter and her husband were here at my wife's funeral. \n\nAt the end, I've decided to go back to studying and finally entered college. It changed my way of perceiving the world and now I'm quite happy. I've also volunteered at some NGOs in my city and it helped me to keep my pace with society.\n\nSo my advice is that you need to get prepared to deal with boredom. We grow up with our parents telling us to go to school, have a job, a car, a house and that this is life. But when you suddenly have the car, the house and everything else, what's left? Do something for yourself and have this in mind. \n\nBoredom hits hard and you need to get prepared to deal with it.\n\nGodspeed to you all!\n\nEDIT: wow, never expected so many reactions to this post! Thanks for the love you all! Will try to reply to some comments soon.\n\nEDIT2: My DM box is flooded with people asking for advice. I did NOT day trade, I simply held whatever I had. I was lucky to be at the right place and time to acquire cheap coins that happened to moon in 2017.\n\nEDIT3: People in the comments saying it\u2019s my fault for not thinking about other aspects of life before having money. You can\u2019t be much of a philosopher without having had the time or money to study. I had to work to eat and lived from paycheck to paycheck for a fair amount of time.

I knew a guy called John. me and him had been friends for a long time, nearly 10 years i think. i got into crypto a while back and i'd obviously talk about it with him, encourage him to start as it is a great hobby to have. John claimed he was too 'busy' to invest, i.e. playing video games all day and jacking off in his uni dorm room.\n\nHowever, recently, John had a change of heart. he wanted to pull himself together and thought that crypto would be the catalyst so he came to me to learn. naturally i was ecstatic, this was one of my best friends and i really enjoy teaching people things. I taught John everything i knew, how to use exchanges, how to set up a wallet, how to spot good projects, the trends of the market etc.. i spent countless hours of my personal time helping him learn basic things (he is a bit slow).\n\nNow, i warned John to steer clear of shitcoins. i told him that although you may get lucky and get rich quick, the chance of this happening is so low and newbies like him fall victim to these scams the most. he was very off put by this and assured me he would avoid them.\n\nA few weeks go buy and i received a very long message from John. He told me he was quitting crypto and he had lost all of his savings he put in. i was shocked, but as i read the message it became clear to me what had happened. he said a youtuber had basically shilled him a 'low market cap' coin telling him he could 50x his money in a week. Yes, John fell victim to a pump and dump.\n\nThis is where it gets worse, i replied asking why would he do this when i advised him otherwise. i got no message back, i called him a few days after and to my shock the phone would instantly hang up. John blocked me on everything, not just phone but instagram, whatsapp, facebook. i was shocked and upset, i had done nothing wrong. i asked one of our mutual friends if i could speak to John, and he told me that John wanted nothing to do with me because i had made him lose all his money,\n\nHe didnt blame himself, or even the scammy youtuber, he blamed the person who introduced him to crypto and **warned** him of scams.\n\nIt really hurts writing this knowing ive lost someone i knew for 10 years over something i didn't even do. i just tried to help.\n\nThe moral of the story is don't advise people to get into crypto, or tell them what to invest in, friends or even family, because when shit goes south the first person they will blame is you.\n\nedit: thanks for all the advice and support guys, ive changed my mind and im no longer sad about this. its better to get rid of people like this now than in the future.",

    "postText": "Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich?? We all need to look at total supply vs market cap to manage our expectations and be more logical about what is possible. The answer to all of those lofty expectations? Impossible. This is a mistake a lot of people are making. You have to look at total supply and multiply it by price per coin to get the market cap. Let\u2019s look at a few popular ones\u2026\n\nBitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. As it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. It has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. After the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. That is huge. The total market cap for ALL crypto is 2.38 trillion. Bitcoin is king. Bigger than Visa and MasterCard combined. Bigger than nearly every world bank. It is the world\u2019s 3rd largest currency. \n\nEthereum has a total supply of 115 million. More coins than Bitcoin. At the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. In July, they are making a change with the London Hardfork, EIP 1559, and every time a transaction is made with ETH, the ETH fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to BTC. Many are saying that ETH will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. When ETH 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. With 115 million in circulation, ETH has a market cap of $400 billion. That\u2019s worth more than all of Walmart. \n\nSo, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. See if the amount seems realistic or not. \n\nLet\u2019s look at DOGE. Doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [EDIT: DOGE mints 10,000\ncoins every *minute*, not every day!]. That\u2019s an additional 5 billion coins each year. If you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. There is $37 trillion dollars in the world. Is DOGE worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? The entire economy of the United States is $25.3 trillion. Is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the US economy\u2026the largest economy in the world?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Stellar Lumens. The max supply is $50 billion. The supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of BTC each year. Anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the US economy. At the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? I say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. I think DOGE would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. \n\nIf DOGE were worth as much as ETH, which I\u2019ve seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, Doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. That\u2019s at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if Google serves me right.\n\nThen you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on Tik-Tok, like Safemoon. I don\u2019t even need to do the math on Safemoon to know it\u2019s a scam. They will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone\u2019s money. The total supply for Safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! Stay away from that. Insanity. \n\nLook at supply of successful coins beyond BTC and ETH and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. Here are some I think worth investing in:\n\nPolkadot (DOT): Total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billion\n\nChainlink (LINK): Total supply: 419 million, max 1 billion\n\nCardano (ADA): Total supply: 45 billion. This coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. Maybe $10-$12 a coin max? But it is under $2 right now. \n\nATOM: Total supply: 248 million. New coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) ATOM. If you can find a good coin that gives you APR, many are 5-6%\u2026much better than a traditional savings account! \n\nAlgorand (ALGO): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold ALGO. \n\nTezos (XTZ), circulating supply: 756 million. Total supply: 763 million. \n\nMANA: this coin is only used for a video game called Decentraland. Atari is making a casino opening in May in that virtual world. Supply available: 1.5 billion. Total supply: 2.6 billion. \n\nPolygon (MATIC): 10 billion, half in circulation. Because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of ETH\u2026which won\u2019t happen\u2026each coin would be worth $35 a coin (Take the market cap of ETH and divide it by the supply of MATIC to see what it would be if it were as huge as ETH). It\u2019s under a dollar now. Maybe it could grow to 1/4 of ETH if we\u2019re being optimistic? That would put it at $8.75 a coin. \n\nEnjin (ENJ) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. \n\nThe list goes on, I just picked a handful of random coins I hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to BTC or ETH\u2019s market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. I don\u2019t expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. And, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. If you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, I\u2019d say that\u2019s an impossibility. Likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as ETH or BTC by simply dividing the market cap for ETH or BTC by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. Your coin won\u2019t grow as big as those two, but it\u2019s a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations. \n\n(Note that some of my supply numbers might be off a little, but they should be in the general ballpark)",

    "postText": "This sub feels less like group of investors debating over tech and more like drunk gamblers throwing money on horse races. It's not a rant, Im just really confused how things change so quickly.  \nThere was a time when people here focused more on the King, on the fundamentals, people discussed serious projects, innovations and different use cases of crypto and adoption.  \nPeople used to form their own opinions from reading up on projects, not braindead parroting what they glanced over scrolling through an article or read in a one-liner here.  \n\n\nNowadays everybody's got their focus on that one overhyped coin that's going to a 100x by the end of the year. Nobody's even read the whitepaper on it, but hey, so much hype, it's gotta be the next moonshot!  \nAnd when it ''does a Squid'' newcomers get burned hard and leave the market for good.   \nI get it's survival of the fittest, but this shilling doesn't help with Adoption, does it?  \n\n\nWhen was the last time you saw a discussion on the King?2-3x by the end of market cycle? Heell no, that's not enough, we want 10x in a month!  \nNobody is happy with 3-5x in 6 months, people want quick gains over night and that's it.  \nRight now, stop any pedestrian on the street and ask them if they want 2x on their money in 3 months. About 95% would think that's too good to be true and in the normal world it is too good to be true.\n\nIt really feels like a group of drunks walked in a Vegas casino trying to choose the one winning slot machine out of a thousand slot machines.  \nCrypto does change things, sadly not always in a positive way.",

    "postText": "For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence. I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.\n\nIf something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow \u201conline payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\u201d\n2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.\n3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don\u2019t try to pump it)\n4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.\n5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.\n6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don\u2019t see a future for it after SEC went after it.\n7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.\n8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin\u2019s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.\n9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.\n10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let\u2019s get Stellar back in the top 10).\n11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.\n12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I\u2019m kidding).\n13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.\n14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.\n15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it\u2019s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.\n16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It\u2019s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.\n17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant\n18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.\n19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism\n20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron\u2019s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.\n21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an \u201cinternet of blockchains\u201d.\n22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that\n23. **Monero (XMR)\\*:** if you need drugs\n24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.\n25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.\n26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD\n27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.\n28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).\n29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.\n30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they\u2019re using it.\n31. **Compound (COMP):** It\u2019s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn\u2019t be around today.\n32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it\u2019s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).\n33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.\n34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.\n35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.\n36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it\u2019s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance\u2019s), for example fees discounts.\n37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there\u2019s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.\n38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.\n39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It\u2019s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.\n40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.\n41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.\n42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain\n43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.\n44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.\n45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.\n46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.\n47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.\n48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.\n49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.\n50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT:\n\nA couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:\n\n* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to \"stay true to Satoshi vision\", trying to improve scalability and stability.\n* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it\u2019s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person\u2019s identity, it\u2019s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",

    "postText": "Why we won't have a long term bear market, and how to systematically pick your future investments in crypto With so much uncertainty right now it would be a good time to take some time to go over what happened recently and how to invest moving foward. We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. \n\n#What's happening now and how bad will it get?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.\n\nDifferent theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the \"January Effect\" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:\n\n1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs\n\n2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year\n\nWhile this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:\n\n* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)\n\n* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)\n\n* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)\n\n* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down\n\n* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses\n\n* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.\n\nSo in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). We don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet.\n\n**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**\n\nIf you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. \n\nThe other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.\n\n**What should long term investors do?**\n\nFor long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit. \n\nEssentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses.\n\n#How to construct your portfolio going forward\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.\n \n\n**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMemes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). \n\nThere is no ideal or \"correct\" methodology but I can outline mine:\n\n**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**\n\nOnce I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. \n\n* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like \"Web 4.0\" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. \n\n* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc\n\n* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? \n\n* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?\n\n\n**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**\n\nI have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:\n\n* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?\n\n* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?\n\n* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?\n\n* What current product exists?\n\n* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?\n\n* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?\n\n\n\n**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** \n\nI have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.\n\n[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.\n\nOnce you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a \"dividend\" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.\n\nThe benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).\n\nIf you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do\n\n* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. \n\n* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. \n\n* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. \n\nOnce you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.\n\nOnce you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how \"smart money\" does it.\n\n**Think about your portfolio allocation**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou should think first in broad terms how you allocate between \"safe\" and \"speculative\" cryptos. \n\nFor new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.\n\nYou should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:\n\n* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc\n\n* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc\n\n* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc\n\n* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc\n\n* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc\n\n* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc\n\nYou should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.\n\n**Think of your \"circle of competence\"**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? \n\nThis where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. \n\n\n**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.\n\n\n#Summing it up\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.\n\nBasically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.\n\nTake care and have fun investing :)\n\n**Edit March 2018**: Lol looking back I'm regretting starting the title with \"Why we won't have a long term bear market\" now, I was more karma whoring with that catchy title than anything.

    "postText": "Selling all my crypto because of an authoritarian government Hi guys,\n\nI'm from a third world country called India. The right-wing fascist government here is planning to ban all cryptocurrencies. (They are so tone-deaf they called Bitcoin a [\"private cryptocurrency\"](https://www.newsweek.com/india-drafts-bill-create-government-cryptocurrency-ban-private-cryptocurrencies-exceptions-1566558)). \n\nOf course, you can never ban Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature and you might be thinking why I am selling my crypto when I could just as easily use a VPN. Well, the answer is that you don't live under this government. In 2019, the country was undergoing civil unrest with riots in the capital in the [CAA protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests) against a bill that discriminated based on religion. They silence journalists, kill protestors, and control not only just the media but also the judiciary. It's. fucked. up.\n\nCurrently, many [farmers of the country are protesting against the new farm laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers) which have been deemed anti-farmers and pro-corporate. The government was apathetic to the protest initially and then they were cruel, and brutal. \n\n[When Greta Thunberg and Rihana tweeted about the issue](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rihanna-farmers-protest-mea-7173657/), the government lost its mind and used the Ministry of External Affairs to issue a statement... against a pop star and a teenager. The protestors are also dealt with harshly and Delhi has been turned into a fortress keeping them out; more than a hundred farmers have died but the government remains apathetic.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India prohibited all banks in India from accepting cryptocurrency transactions in 2018. However, the industry went to the Supreme Court and the order was deemed unconstitutional in March last year. The crypto industry rose in India again and just as more people were buying in, the government comes out with a bill that fines a person 3x to 10x their gains on crypto or a jail term up to 10 years, or both. \n\nThe worst part is that the bill states that it's up to the government to decide how people should dispose of their crypto after its banned. And you know what, it's not beyond this government to take all the crypto for themselves and claim they \"destroyed it\". [All governments have a history with corruption in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_in_India). My exchange is linked to my bank accounts and my central government tax ID, and they can easily track me. \n\nThat's why I'm selling everything I have, for now, just to wait it out and see what happens with the bill here. I really don't want to sell but I think it's better if I cash out instead of letting the government decide what I should do with my coins or face jail time.\n\nI know India is probably not in your circle of concern right now but Bitcoin was about decentralization, about resisting government censorship and it seems the fanatical government is hellbent on making sure nobody can hold crypto by threatening harsh punishments and penalties. However, this is also good for crypto because the government is scared of it due to its growing power, just like its scared of Rihana and Greta Thunberg. \n\nI hope the bill never passes but most likely it will and bring an end to the crypto industry here again.\n\nEDIT - /u/makeingcent5 gave this post a Platinum Award which comes with 700 coins. I have never received reddit coins before and never had the chance to award comments or posts so I'll distribute it to as many top comments here as I can. Cryptocurrency might be about decentralizion but it also brings the world a bit closer in a way. Thank you. /u/Pos1tivity gilded this post and 100 more coins have been redistributed to top comments\n\nSince this post has become so visible, here's a campaign Indian exchanges are running - https://www.indiawantsbitcoin.org/\n\nLast Edit - It's 5:21 AM here and I'm crashing. Thank you for all the support and comments, cryptocurrency is the future and nothing can stop it no matter what governments try. I just hope this post raised awareness about what's happening in this part of the world and why it's so dishearting. You'll are the best.",

The fake bots will already downvote this thread but I am hoping it will at least reach some actual users in here.\n\nHere are a few coins that I looked into that are completely scams but are widely being promoted.\n\nSafemoon, safemars, safegalaxy, elongate, Zepplin dao, ravenX, fox finance, moon pirate, moonrate, hungry bear. Basically any coin which says \"they will give you coins for any transaction on the chain and then will burn x% more\".\n\nThe idea of naming it \"Safe\" \"moon\" should be a good enough of a red flag.  Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of the coins. You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to promote it. These coins have no utility, it is just a ponzi scheme with the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders investment if you bail out early before the rug pull. These people are trying hard to get you into safemoon etc. because they wanna hoard more money and they don't give a fuck about the people who are gonna be bag holders in the end.\n\nDo not think that lot of people are buying the coins and you are gonna be missing out on 100x gains, majority of the people posting screen shots or talking about their experience are fake profiles.\n\nHow they try to entice you?\n\n1. They are going to show their profits\n2. They are going to promise exchange listing (Binance, Kucoin, their own exchange) which will never come I promise you.\n3. They say they are transparent because they put couple of stooges for some dogshit AMA\n4. They come up with some charity cause to make you feel not guilty about being part of a ponzi scheme or play on your good nature in general.\n5. They make the coin value be well below 1 dollar like ($0.0000001) so its more enticing to you to get in on, giving you hope that its going to reach 1 dollar someday LOL.\n\nIt's mind blowing how some people play these mental gymnastics with themselves  to justify their ponzi scheme. \"I made 100x gains\", \"is it wrong for the little guy to make money\", \"i will put 50% of  profits into legit coins\".\n\nI don't want these shit coins to be the face of crypto for all the new comers. Stop promoting/getting into these scam coins for a quick buck, it is just gonna give crypto space a bad name.\n\nDYOR.",

    "postText": "Caution! This sub has some of the worst investing advice I've ever seen, and it's full of people who think they're Warren Buffet because they won a billion dollars in the lottery. Let me begin by saying that if you invested $1,000 in bitcoin when it was first released, you are most likely very wealthy today. But don't let that detract from the fact that it elevates you to the status of someone who wired $1,000 to an anonymous person on the internet in exchange for some magical beans.\n\nYou'd be stupid not to have money invested in cryptocurrency these days, but keep in mind that it's almost entirely based on speculation, and a lot of your success is based on pure luck. In a bull market, everyone is a brilliant investor. People who post here pretending to be seasoned investing gurus are more often than not people who got lucky a few times. Have fun with your Baron Rothschild memes, pretending that everyone who invests in cryptocurrency will become a millionaire.\n\nThis is not the first time in history that a generation of young people has gotten rich by jumping on a wild speculation train. People had the same attitudes at the height of the dotcom bubble. \"Twenty-five percent returns in a year?\" Those are scrub figures. Anything less than 100% is not acceptable!\" We all know how that ride ended, and this one will as well. This ride will come to an end, whether it ends in a major bust or becomes a mainstream financial tool dominated by Wall Street. Take advantage of the high returns while you can.\n\nLastly, If you have the money to do so you can manage your risk by diversifying. Yes, the goal of diversification is to have a completely uncorrelated asset. Because all cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with one another, diversifying requires diversifying in a completely different asset class. Investing in another coin is not considered diversification; it is equivalent to investing in McDonald's and KFC and calling it diversification. \n\nAs always, thank you for your time.",

My funds were on Metamask.\"\n\nCrypto Wojak 2: \"Oh fuck Metamask ffs!!!\"\n\n10 hours later:\n\nCrypo Wojak 1: \"Oh guys I totally forgot to say this but I clicked a Discord link and they asked me to validate my wallet for free NFTs so I put in my seed phrase and after that my funds were drained. But lemme just write a post saying I got HACKED and METAMASK SUXXXX!!!!\"\n\n\\---------------------\n\nFor fuck's sake, most of the people that lost their crypto money got SCAMMED, not HACKED. Did someone suddenly invent a quantum computer capable of breaking SHA-256 cryptography? Because that's literally what it takes to 'hack' your crypto wallet without your seed phrase. \n\nThe whole point of crypto is that NOBODY, no MACHINE, no CIA, no NSA, no Illuminati, no Bogdanoff can HACK your crypto wallet, that's the whole fucking point of crypto ffs. So you can fucking imagine why ppl start to panic when some rando Wojaks that got scammed like a noob but cries out loud how he got 'hacked'. Then everyone starts to think 'what if this happened to me????' and 'does this mean Ledger and Metamask are not safu??'\n\nIf only people could be clear and write out step by step what actually happened and stop spreading these bullshit fear stories.",

    "postText": "Coinbase have stolen my Eth deposit and ignored my correspondence with them. A quick search of their support sub reveals they do this a lot and apparently they're getting away with it. I deposited ETH, from an address I have used many times, to my CB address I have used many times without issues. Deposit made on Christmas day 2021.\n\nI got the usual CB email saying they'd received my deposit, and the tx is confirmed on etherscan.\n\nThe coins were never put into my portfolio.\n\nI opened a support ticket, and got a vague non-answer by reply (we're looking into it). It was promptly closed without explanation. I have since opened another 3 tickets which have all been met with similar vague responses, and then the tickets are closed without explanation. My requests to make a complaint have been ignored. I posted on their subreddit 2 weeks ago and got another vague response, no DMs etc.\n\nI've posted there again today but don't expect much.\n\nMy account is not suspended etc., I am still able to transact with existing funds and deposit fiat. I tested this yesterday.\n\nThe funny thing is I trade high volume and had I continued using CBP, I would have paid them multiples of the value of this deposit in fees over the next 12 months. Congrats, you played yourselves.\n\nI was able to live with CBP constantly going down during periods of volatility (sus AF!) but this is crossing the line.\n\n**I am purely posting to encourage others to stay away from coinbase and CBP.** I am not the first person this has happened to. There are literally hundreds of posts like mine on their support sub where people have had funds vanish and the support team just ignores them.\n\nAside from this their fee structure sucks anyway. People seem think CBP is the cheapest for fees but they're only the cheapest if you trade over $100k per month. I only used them because it was a quick cash onramp from my Revolut account. I'll be sticking with Binance and Kraken from here on out. I will also be looking at the LRC DEX because they pay you to trade.\n\nBe careful where you leave your funds.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people doubting the legitimacy of my post which I guess is healthy skepticism. When I get home from work I will redact my personal details and edit in links to my (very one sided) correspondence with Coinbase.\n\nEdit 2: I've done the above with mods.\n\n**Edit 3: RESOLUTION!** Thank you all so much for your support. I'm happy to report that Coinbase were **magically** able to resolve my issue straight away after I tagged their reddit support account on this post. I received the mail in this image:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/b61rYK8\n\nI went straight to filing a complaint and within about 10 minutes my account was credited with the missing funds. They have devalued by about 30% ish since I sent them, and I sent them to be sold immediately at the time, but I seriously doubt I'll get anything else out of CB. I'm just glad to get my coins back at last.\n\nThank you all again. Naming and shaming most definitely works.\n\nAlso, a final word, a lot of people are looking for alternative exchange recommendations. I am in the EU and use binance a lot, also have a Kraken account and they have been recommended by a lot of people. But I know these aren't great options for some people in the USA.\n\nI'm also going to look at using the LRC DEX for trading as they pay you to trade via negative fees! Amazing. I don't believe there's any geo blocks on this either. The issue I experienced makes me think DEXs are the way forward.\n\nGood luck to everyone this year, don't forget to buy high and sell low \ud83d\ude80",

    "postText": "Sam Bankman just cashed out $600k, in violation of his bail release terms and conditions. A wallet directly linked to him has been using shady no-KYC exchanges to swap out It seems that Sam Bankman is already violating his bail release terms and conditions. \n\nAs per his bail release, he may not transact over $1000 without approval.  If he violates the terms, his bond may be forfeited - which means his parents home could be forfeited.\n\nLets look at what the scammer has been upto: \n\nIn 2020, he tweeted his wallet addresses in an effort to seek ownership control over SushiSwap. \n\n[Sam casually tweets his address out. ok uh](https://preview.redd.it/8e7seijnwy8a1.jpg?width=1228&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a88f627679cfedc94ea53519eb70afd72c96f619)\n\nAnd just to confirm he completely controlled this address, the then head of SushiSwap - Nomichef tweets that he has transferred control of Sushi to Sam.\n\n[Nomi: I'm transferring control to SBFAlameda now.](https://preview.redd.it/ix5d08pbxy8a1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06cb4e40082be251228cd308b8a5b18b5a25f847)\n\nAnd what do you know... this wallet was just emptied out, right after Sam got released on bail.\n\nHere is the wallet: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xd57581d9e42e9032e6f60422fa619b4a4574ba79](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd57581d9e42e9032e6f60422fa619b4a4574ba79) (lets label this as \"**0xd575**\")\n\nAround 0.66eth was sent out from here to another wallet, thus emptying this wallet. \n\nAnd if you follow the trail from here, the funds finally end up on a no-KYC exchange: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8f296def58797cc48c5e6bdc047535b2eecaeab](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8f296def58797cc48c5e6bdc047535b2eecaeab)\n\nOver $50k were swapped in this manner. \n\nThis is just in one wallet. One of the other intermediary wallet which received funds from \"**0xd575**\" is \"**0x7386**\". This wallet has recieved hundreds of thousand in the last couple of days, all of them eventually cashing out to no-KYC exchange. \n\nHere is that intermediary wallet: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x7386df2cf7e9776bce0708072c27d6a7135d51cb](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7386df2cf7e9776bce0708072c27d6a7135d51cb)\n\nThe pattern is similar - the wallet receives funds, and swaps them via no-KYC exchange to launder the funds.\n\nThis shows that the wallet that is directly linked to Sam has been cashing out. \n\nThese are not transactions made by the Bankruptcy trustee, since any transaction they make has to be signed off by the bankruptcy court first and furthermore, they wouldnt use a no-kyc exchange to hide their trail.",

But the media is jumping around giddy reporting on billionaires in space.

I am by no means an expert on rockets or energy usage of crypto, there are great comments describing these in detail. I know I was being extreme in the title and bringing up energy so please go ahead and roast me for my ignorance. Grateful for the discussion here as the energy usage of mining should be of course a concern to all. I love space and science and I love crypto.

All bets are off, and we might be about to see the first *true* crypto crash - and it might knock the wind out of even the hardest hodlers. I\u2019m seeing far too much chatter from people who are a.) sure we are entering a 2 year bear market and others who are b.) sure this is just a dip in an extended cycle.  \n  \nI have a question for all of you people: when was the last time you were hungry, and I mean really hungry?  When was the last time you were already late for rent and wondering what around your house you could sell to make up the difference?  \n  \nMake no mistake: I am a crypto maximalist.  One of the OGs.  But I also strive to be a realist.  And let me assure you: people who can\u2019t afford basic necessities don\u2019t have time for made up internet coins.  \n  \nAfter being involved with crypto for many years I went through a rough patch in 2019 - 2020 where I was on food stamps and begging for rent money on social media.  I was selling my shit on eBay and relying on charity to make it from one month to the next.  I gotta say, I gave zero shits about what was going on in crypto land.  My vision was focused on just making it day to day.  \n  \nAnd I think a lot of people are going to end up in that same mindset if a real recession hits us.  People aren\u2019t gonna have extra money to buy *any* crypto, not monkey nfts, not dog coins, not Algorand, not Ether, not even fucking Bitcoin itself.  \n  \nAnd I think you should mentally prepare for that.  \n  \nIt should be a possibility on your mental list that crypto might be about to experience it\u2019s first *true* crash, and it will seem like an extinction level event.  \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n  \nedit: the fact that this is getting almost unanimously derided as bullshit (originally was downvoted to zero) suggests to me that I\u2019m probably right.  Y\u2019all ride that hopium into the ground.  To make money in this game you need to do the *opposite* of what everyone believes.  It\u2019s okay, I remember what my first bull market felt like too.  \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n  \nedit 2: I don\u2019t have the energy to reply to the hundreds of comments screeching \u201chow are you an OG if you were on food stamps!\u201d as if people can\u2019t make mistakes, and if they do, as if they suddenly don\u2019t have wisdom to share.  The mistakes are what creates the wisdom.  My alt account is /u/americanpegasus.  I have been in crypto since 2012, and during the past ten years have both made and lost extraordinary sums of money.

The things is, they started being bad for many things, not just crypto.\n\nThey are getting paid to scam their fans, and they are scumbags on this planet.\n\nHow many times we saw videos on youtube, tiktok or any other platform with coins or tokens that are going to skyrocket and you should get in ASAP?\n\nHow many of those same youtubers, tiktokers etc. got rich because their tehnical analysis is amazing and they share knowledge that we should be thankfull about?\n\nThey are promoting risky, or sometimes even non existent coins and tokens.\n\nPeople who are just getting into crypto are sometimes listening to them, investing blindly in what they say and lose money.

    "postText": "I don't care if you invested $100 or $1M. You're doing something for your future and we should all respect that. Don't let anyone bring you down because you can only afford $100 to invest in crypto. If a few hundred dollars is a significant amount for you, then the gains on that will also be significant. Time in the market is a huge factor, so if you're young and patient, chances are you'll make decent money even with less invested. \n\nMoreover, a smaller investment at first is ideal to test the waters, it gives you time to properly understand how crypto works, and do your own research on several projects.\n\nI was also a broke college student when I put my first $200 in crypto in 2017. I wasn't really active in this sub because I felt like I was not part of this community. Most of the guys here were talking about lambos & yachts, and to be honest, at first I would've been super happy to just double my investment and buy gas to visit my GF more frequently.  \n\nOnly invest what you can afford to lose, do your own research, and don't be afraid to ask!",

I praised BTC in the past so many times because it introduced me to concepts I never thought about, but this recent news of billionaires joining the party got me thinking. Since when are the people teaming up with those that are the root cause of their problems?\n\nNow I know that some names like Elon Musk can be pardoned for one reason or another but seeing Michael Saylor and Mark Cuban talk Bitcoin with the very embodiment of centralization - CZ Binance... I don't like where this is going.\n\nNot to mention that we all expected BTC to become peer-to-peer cash, not a store of value for edgy hedge funds... It feels like we are going in the opposite direction when compared to the DeFi space and community-driven projects.\n\n\nAs far as I am concerned, the king is dead. The Billionaire Friends & Co are holding him hostage while telling us that everything is completely fine. This is not what I came here for and what I stand for. I still believe decentralization will prevail even if the likes of Binance keep faking transactions on their chains and claiming that the \"users\" have abandoned ETH.\n\n\nMay the Binance brigade have mercy on this post.

    "postText": "Last night I was the victim of a SIM swap. It all happened very quickly.\n\nAt about 11:58PM I received a text that a new phone service had been activated on my number with a carrier I don't use. It came with a link to a password protected (PIN setup when the service was purchased) PDF file that contained the contract for the start of service. I had a friend of mine crack the password to the PDF which ended up being 13371337 (lol). They filled out the form with bogus info for the name and address.\n\n[Password protected start of service form.](https://preview.redd.it/geqpvl86wp171.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcdea3cf9b228c6c2af0534b6a402ccc92d2b799)\n\nAt this point my phone number had already been stolen and my phone lost service, being unable to text or make phone calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried logging into my email account, and the password had been changed. Since my mobile number was linked to my email account, the attacker was able to now use my number to get the code to reset the password. I thought I had removed the phone number from this account but apparently I missed it. At some point last year I anticipated this happening and switched most of my 2FA to google authenticator instead of SMS, which ended up saving my ass last night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt around 1:44 AM I was thankfully able to regain access to my email account by using my backup email address on file which the attacker thankfully hadn't changed, and also provided some other info to my email provider to prove ownership.\n\nAt first nothing seemed out of place until I checked my deleted messages folder and saw password reset requests for three different cryptocurrency exchanges I have held accounts on. Two of these don't hold many funds but the third currently holds a fair amount of my coins. (This is another reason you should keep your coins off of the exchange).\n\nTime frame was as follows:\n\n**11:58 PM:** I get a text about service being activated for my phone number, I lose phone service.\n\n**12:08 AM:** My email password is reset. I don't notice this for over an hour.\n\n**12:09 AM:** Coinbase password reset request.\n\n**12:13 AM:** Kucoin verification code sent to my email.\n\n**12:14 AM:** Kraken username request sent to email.\n\n**12:15 AM:** Kraken password reset request sent to email.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see ***the entire attack lasted less than 20 minutes***, which is terrifying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThankfully I had Google Authenticator 2FA setup on all of these accounts so the hackers were not able to gain access and drain my funds. Anyone using SMS verification should switch to Google Authenticator because this is the one thing that kept my coins safe. I still need to recover my phone number and at this point I feel like I should change my number or carrier. My mobile carrier only requires a 4 digit pincode to login and make changes which is probably one of the weakpoints that allowed this attack to happen.\n\nMy information was leaked in the Ledger breach that happened last year and I am positive that this leak is what caused me to be attacked last night. I am sure I am on a list being passed around and some of you might be as well. Please exercise caution, secure your passwords and enable Google Authentication and 2FA on everything you can.\n\nEdit: So I spent all day at the carrier stores to get this figured out. Since my number was ported over, then cancelled, I was unable to port it back to my original carrier to finish out my month of service. I went to Metro by T-Mobile and was able to get my number back but I had to buy a new phone since my current device is not unlocked. All in all I ended up having to spend about $200 to get my number back.",

The liquidity pool was closed by the devs since the beginning, meaning that NO ONE could sell/swap their tokens for BNB or USDT or anything else.

    "postText": "Solend, the largest lending market on Solana is about to have a crippling liquidation of $170m SOL that could crash the network. To prevent this, the decentralized protocol is proposing to seize the user's funds via governance There is a large liquidation watch on Solana's Solend protocol, where a whale has  deposited 5.7M SOL  ($170M and borrowed 108M USDC and USDT borrowed. This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. \n\nThe whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. \n\nHowever such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. \n\nThe Solend team explains what could happen to the network:\n\n>This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  \n>  \n>**Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.**  DEX liquidity isn\u2019t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.\n\nSo to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user's funds and execute OTC trades:\n\n>Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale\u2019s  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale\u2019s account reaches a safe  level.\n\nWhen shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. \n\nThese shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! \n\nAnd during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.",

    "postText": "Whether you've invested 100$ or 100k, if you're in this space, you're way ahead of the line... PSA for anybody in here, especially people who compare their gains to others, give in to FOMO and are hitting their heads due to thinking in hindsight.\n\nThe vast majority of people do not invest any kind of money into their future, all they think about is how to spend it on material stuff - as long as you're intrigued by the idea of holding a bunch of currencies that could potentially bring you financial freedom in the future - you're doing really great!\n\nYou really don't have to catch the next big thing or every single moonshot opportunity, as long as you're in crypto and chipping in funds every now and then, you're setting yourself up for great success in the future.\n\nOnce you've made substantial gains is also isn't a bad idea to diversify your investments, but that's on you. Getting out of debt is an investment too. Taking the time to understand projects and learn new things is an investment in yourself.  \n\n\nEdit: Pressed enter too early.   \n\n\nAnyways, props to you for being here and keep up being part of a global change for the better. You're killing it!   \n",

    "postText": "Today is this first day of my nearly 3 decades of life that I have 1000 USD in savings. I got my tax return today and it went straight into BTC. I'm still pretty new at the whole Crypto thing, finally taking a deep dive and learning as much as possible in early February of this year after trying to trade to make fiat in '17 and' 20. I see it totally different than I did before, and am now a firm HODLer. \n\nI know $1000 isn't much but this feels like a big accomplishment for me. I've never been good about saving money, simply content with working and living paycheck to paycheck. When that stimmy comes you know right where it's going.\n\nI'm thankful for this sub despite being a lurker. This is a cool community with plenty of users that will remind you not to fall into FOMO, be careful what you invest, and beware of scams.",

    "postText": "Cashing out tonight because I finally met my goal of buying a house! I have been a crypto investor since 2017 but only took it serious over the last year. Up until last July I have always been a McDonald's manager. I was the fix it manager sent into problem stores to change how they operate to make profit targets. I made garbage wages, was treated like garbage, and I felt like garbage.\n\nIn 2014 I went back to school to study an engineering technology diploma and then last year went back again to take an advanced diploma in Ocean Technology. I got my dream job making better money. With my first few paychecks I put $100 into Ethereum. I continued until October until I had invested $1500 (Canadian) and I sat on it until now. \n\nAs of tonight between investing in gamestop and my cryptocurrency investments I have enough for a large down-payment on a house and enough for lawyers fees and moving fees. We have placed an offer in on a great house and we close the deal on May 4th. \n\nI want to thank the cryptocurrency community for keeping me strong when I felt like I was about to lose it all and for also reminding me that taking profits is okay. I believe in Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole and I have no doubt I could make more money. But, I have met my goal and it is time for me to take profits.\n\n**Edit 1 - Thank you everyone for the kind words! I am blown away by the community that exists on this subreddit. This is not the end of my crypto days, it is just a stepping stone.",

It has been exactly 3 months now trying to get my money back. What is the problem here? I am losing my patience, how would you like it if a company locked your account and wouldn\u2019t give you your $100,000 back? Why did you accept the wire transfer only to close my account a minute later and make me fight for my money? If within the minutes of you accepting the wire transfer and locking the account, that means you knew that you shouldn\u2019t have accepted it. You guys are playing with me. It doesn\u2019t take a month to review 5 pages of info and send a wire transfer. Do I need to buy a plane ticket and pay you a visit? Email doesn\u2019t seem to be working too well. I have a cousin in California who is a judge as well and will take legal action. I didn\u2019t want to play this card but I have no choice left, if this goes for another week. I want my money back. And where is the harm in sending back money exactly where it came from? I really don\u2019t see why you have dragged this on for so long. Am I being targeted being over 80 years old? Are you waiting for me to die to keep the money?\u00a0  \n>  \n>Don\u2019t give me a one sentence response. I want full detail of the matter and an estimation of when that money will be back in the Ryan Electric bank account. For all I know, I am getting bullshitted by you guys, and you may not even be doing anything to fix this. Just keep dragging it on for another year, maybe I\u2019ll be dead by then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell well well, you send them a nasty letter and they are right on top of it.\n\n> Hi-  \n  \n>  \n>I'm really sorry about the delay here, somehow this ticket was pushed back in our queue. We are definitely handling this and I reminded the team as well. They did ask for one more thing, can you get a note from your bank stating that the R\\*\\*\\* Electric corporate account was closed? We will need that to proceed. I will be handling this going forward, don't hesitate in asking questions and I'll make sure I answer them in a timely manner. Thank you and again, apologies on the delay here.\u00a0  \n  \n>  \n>Best,  \n>  \n>Biggs  \nBinance.US Support\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis dude is acting like he is here to help, and he had us fooled. Anyways we apologized for that email.\n\n> Thanks Biggs. Sorry for my rant, I appreciate the response. The R\\*\\*\\* Electric Corporate bank account is still open as I am still chasing invoices from when I was in business. The business itself is closed.\u00a0 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**November 23rd:**\n\n> Hi,  \n  \n>  \n>It's completely understandable. I need to follow up with the other team, just left them a memo and will touch base when I hear back. Feel free to message me if you do not hear from me tomorrow, but I expect to have an update then.\u00a0  \n  \n>  \n>Best,  \n>  \n>Biggs  \nBinance.US Support\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Hi, you should be good to withdraw now.

Sent him an email.\n\n> When I go to the wire withdraw page, it has my name locked in and I can't change it to R\\*\\*\\* Electric.

I tried again, and the same thing is happening. I attached some screenshots. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**November 27th:** \n\n>Hey Biggs, I\u2019m not sure what to do about the wire transfer. I triple checked all the information and I know it\u2019s correct. It knows the bank name automatically once I enter the information, which means to me the routing number is correct. It says failed under the status for each try I did. Even right after I put the info in, I never seen it say pending, or open, just failed. I\u2019m not getting the email to confirm that I want to withdraw, so I don\u2019t think your team will ever get it.\u00a0I tried to use the checking account number instead of my savings and that didn\u2019t work either. I can\u2019t change the name of the wire\u00a0to try to send it to the R\\*\\*\\* Electric account, so I\u2019m not sure what I should do. If you would let me buy DAI then get off your exchange, that would work, but don\u2019t know the legality of that. Let me know, it\u2019s been over that 72hr limit and I\u2019m not sure what to do here.\u00a0\u00a0  \n>  \n>Thanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis response\n\n> Hi, still looking for a solution here, don't worry I'll make sure it gets handled.

I didn't try to do ACH originally because my grandparents are scared of online banking. I sent this email asking about doing ACH and if it is alright, and in the mean time, convicted my grandparents to sign up for online banking with Washington Trust, since that was the only bank that they have that was on Biances ACH list.\n\nMind you the account has been active now for a couple months, with withdrawals only enabled.\n\n**December 6th:**\n\n>Hey Biggs, my money is still on the exchange and wire withdrawals don't work it seems. Is there a way to maybe go straight to Prime Trust to withdraw it? I see there is ACH, as well, not something I really want to do, but would it work if I setup online banking with Washington Trust? Or would it not work since my account is limited?  \n>  \n>Thanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NO RESPONSE AT ALL BUT THEY FUCKING DEACTIVED THE ACCOUNT RIGHT AFTER THAT EMAIL ASKING ABOUT AN ALTERNATE WAY TO GET THE MONEY OFF THE EXCHANGE**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**December 7th:**\n\n>Hey, I am looking to talk to Biggs.

I need to get my money off the exchange, and I have been trying wire withdrawals at different times, and none of them worked. I never got the confirmation email, on 5 or more tries. I tried different banks, and accounts, nothing. I never heard back about it either. I never done online banking, but I saw ACH on the withdrawals page, and since wire isn't working, I decided to bite the bullet and enable my online banking with Washington Trust.  \n  \n>  \n>My account has been limited from trading for over a month now, and only had it enabled to withdraw, which never worked with the wire method. I never got help form you guys, after sending multiple emails.  \n  \n>  \n>A couple days ago, I emailed you guys about trying this ACH transfer, asking if it would work. In the meantime I went ahead and got online banking setup anyway. The very next day my account is locked. Having it limited for months, then me emailing you the day before, asking about me trying ACH, then having the account DISABLED just before I got setup with my bank for online banking, looks like a scam. A lot of actions over the past 5 months have seemed like a scam.  \n  \n>  \n>What happened to Biggs taking this ticket personally until I got settled? Seems after I never got confirmation emails from the wire withdrawals, and adding Prime Trust to my email contracts/whitelist didn't work, he just stopped talking to me.  \n  \n>  \n>Last time I was ignored, I had to send a nasty email to you guys, then all of a sudden I started to get help. Then I cooled down, and yet again you guys are ignoring me.  \n  \n>  \n>This has been quite a few emails now without a response.  \n  \n>  \n>Get back to me soon, or I will have to take legal action. This is absolutely ridiculous. All my emails and screenshots I have taken, I am ready to go to court.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**January 11th:** \n\n  Sent them an email\n\n>You're killing me here with this whole thing.

    "postText": "Coinbase has become the new Robinhood. They're artificially withholding Algorand withdrawals because of liquidity issues and do not want to lose out on their governance rewards. It has been over 24 hours now and they're pretending it's a technical issue. My guess is Coinbase is running on fractional reserves and doesn't wanna lose out on it's governance rewards so they are artificially delaying withdrawals of ALGO. I don't know about you guys but after I get my ALGO's withdrawn I'm finding an alternative to CoinBase. They have officially lost my business which is a shame because I've used them since getting into crypto.\n\nThey did this exact same thing before the 1st governance period in September and people lost out on signing up. This is no different than what Robinhood did with GME stock. It just shows that CEX's need regulation desperately and we're currently at the mercy of Coinbase assholes.\n\nThere have also been other strange things between Coinbase and Algorand. For the longest time they had Algorand listed as an ERC-20 token. Additionally they commonly do not post updated/correct news for Algorand. A few days ago they listed Securitizes Tokenization of Down Jones Index Funds as happening on Ethereum instead of Algorand, since then they've taken it down from Ethereum but haven't posted it to Algorand news.\n\nThis all smells a bit fishy.  I have been having this feeling for a while that coinbase is deliberately trying to undermine Algorand.\n\nDoes anyone know of a good alternative to Coinbase and Binance in the US?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: They canceled my withdrawal after over 24 hours pending and said \"Blockchain transaction was compensated\". I'm wondering if I should try to withdraw again or convert to another coin and transfer off.\n\nEDIT 2: Tried withdrawing again and it canceled almost immediately and said the same thing \"Blockchain transaction was compensated.\" I'm pretty sure they still took my .002 ALGO transaction fee though. CB is fucking us over royally.\n\nEDIT 3: Tried withdrawing once more, instant withdrawal cancel with same reason as before. I'm done trying to withdraw tonight. Will try again tomorrow in the AM and update the post.\n\nEDIT 4: I was finally able to withdraw my ALGO's today. Look's like Coinbase most likely saw this post and bought more ALGO. The amount of ALGO in Coinbase 2 doubled and magically withdrawals were reenabled. Which means this was 100% a liquidity issue, and not a technical issue. Thank you everyone for contributing, I'm proud to be a part of this community. The elites get scared when all us little guys work together, never forget how powerful we are when we work collectively. This is the exact reason why we are all here, so huge monolithic entities can't dictate and control our lives without any recourse.\n\nEDIT 5: MAKE COINBASE SQUIRM. Withdraw everything. Coinbase 1 is down to 351 ALGO and Coinbase 2 is down to <1 Million ALGO. Let's clean them out. Hopefully they will learn not to do this again.\n\nEDIT 6: I've been reading some people are still having problems withdrawing. ",

    "postText": "Bitcoin energy usage IS a problem, and the crypto space would only benefit if everyone admitted that. Let's be real, a lot of people here think bitcoin's energy consumption is not a problem, or it's just green people envious that they didn't make money.\n\nThe top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. \n\nI'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are \"features\" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  \n\n\"but defi is the future, we don't need banks\". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.\n\n\"the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future\". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. \n\nCrypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting \"I'm the king\". \n\nTL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.",

    "postText": "Bitcoin will become legal tender in El Salvador, and this won't end well I live in El Salvador, proof of here:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/SmC1o9c (banana and mango for scale)\n\nSo, what's going on right now in El Salvador? How did we get here?\n\nSince Nayib Bukele announced that Bitcoin will become legal tender in El Salvador, you guys preferred profits over people. Why? Well, Nayib Bukele used his popularity to trick everyone he is a \"cool guy\", willing to sacrify himself in the name of the people. But, yeah he is just a Trump-wannabe that uses people's ignorance to stay popular. For example, he is blaming George Soros for pretty much eveything:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9P\n\nYeah, everything: https://imgur.com/gallery/yRqyZV1\n\nFrom accusing Human Rights Watch director ob being financed by George Soros: https://imgur.com/gallery/IyXFeBh\n\nTo accuse journalists of being paid by Soros: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/1CscRa4\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/JXUDigc\n\n\nAnd even accusing congressmen/congresswomen of being financed by Soros because they supported the Engel List (A list of corrupt politicians in Central America)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9P\n\nBonus track: Nayib Bukele even tried to interfere in a local US election, by asking people not to vote for a Congresswoman:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/A9ytFTB\n\nYou did it reddit, you are supporting a President who is using the same ultra right-wing tactics that Trump used. \n\nNow, what's going on right now in El Salvador? \n\nDarkness. No really, we are being left on the dark. The Parliament approved the Bitcoin Law in LESS than six hours, and it was done very late at night:\n\nhttps://diarioelsalvador.com/asamblea-cerca-de-aprobar-el-bitcoin-como-moneda-de-curso-legal/90324/\n\nSome of our congressmen didn't even know what they were voting for, for real:\n\nhttps://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/nacional/diputado-reynaldo-cardoza-no-entiende-bitcoin-apoyo-salvadorenos/871633/2021/\n\nHowever, passing the law wasn't enough, since our country is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic. How is the government funding the Bitcoin Law? By reducing the education, and health budget and using that money to built the Bitcoin infraestructure: \n\nhttps://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Restan-fondos-a-Salud-Educacion-y-asignan-a-Ley-Bitcoin-20210830-0081.html\n\n(BTW I thought you guys were against reducing education budgets)\n\nHow is that money being used? We don't know. All of the information regarding the construction of Chivo ATMs, purchasing Chivo ATMs, purchasing Bitcoins, and the USD $30 bonus is NOW classified information. There you have it, we don't know who was awarded the lucrative contracts to build and equipt the Chivo ATMs. \n\nThat hasn't stopped Nayib Bukele of proudly making Bitcoin related announcements:\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/jidE0oI\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/p26xqnl\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/RdYxP1f\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/ZtNqni5 (For real, no one knows about the costs of construction)\n\nPeople are against using Bitcoin as legal tender. They don't care if someone trades Bitcoin/Ethereum/Ada/Shiba/Solana, the people living in El Salvador don't want is as a legal tender. We already went through this with the Dollar, it was utter chaos. Protests are starting to gather more and more attention:\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/Fs9Z9G9\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/3xtJutO\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/HxpJKWR\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/tlHMgUO\n\nTrust me, people here are not prepared to use Wallets or trade Bitcoins. You really don't know the situation in El Salvador, where people can take pictures with a smartphone or upload videos but don't know what an email is or how to reply to one. Even worst, old people cannot even understand what a password is. If you think that we \"need to educate people about Wallets and Cryptocurrencies because it is the future\", well come here and teach Salvadorans from rural areas about how to use a Wallet. Purchase a plane ticket and go to places like Cacaopera, Sesori, Chirilagua, San Alejo, Conchagua, and teach people about 2FA and Wallets. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not against Cryptocurrencies. I have in my portfolio BTC, SOL, DODGE, ADA, ETH, and even DOT. I tried teaching people about Wallets, its uses and how easy is to send money across the country or the world.

    "postText": "The market is crashing, and so is Crypto. The harsh truth is, the Fed is tightening its monetary policies and they're going to be raising interest rates very soon. The inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. As money is harder to get with the Fed reducing its balance sheet, there will be less money to invest into Crypto and the market.\n\n# The Crash Has Already Started\n\nWhen the Fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates, I warned about a market crash in a post I made just 10 days ago. Unfortunately, the crash I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely.\n\n[Nasdaq Index Falling](https://preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b0b9fcffc58081d9477139f54bf4334b97e94c3)\n\nThe pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like we've seen in 2008. This is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. We can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action.\n\n# Surging Inflation and Market Crash\n\nIf we see the history, every time there was high inflation, the Fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.\n\n[Inflation and Interest rate correlation](https://preview.redd.it/wd2srkb9x0d81.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=628ff4587a8298793996352607cec9b84c928f16)\n\nThis rise in interest rate and the planned decrease of the Fed's balance sheet is going to have a severe impact on the market as people start borrowing less, spending less and investments into all assets start to dwindle.\n\n# Biden Approval Rating\n\n[Approval Ratings Fall Sharply Due To Inflation Concerns](https://preview.redd.it/tbvvccadx0d81.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=e10b55e73781fccb335a8fb7f7203a709023a84b)\n\nWith more and more inflation, people are losing trust in the Government and the approval rating is going down. The main reason behind this huge fall in approval rating is inflation, and the government needs to tackle inflation if they want to keep their approval rating from falling even lower as the public takes notice of their bills. The approval rating is a sign that the government needs to tackle inflation if it wants to keep public support.\n\n# The Sell-off and the Opportunity\n\nWith the market crash ahead being very likely, people are taking their money out faster and faster. The Fed is no longer giving them free money very soon. The amount of people that are buying assets very low considering the current situation, and it is likely going to start going down as the interest rates are yet to be increased, which is when we will see the peak effects of the upcoming crash.\n\nHowever, when crashes are at their peak, they leave most assets EXTREMELY undervalued. These are the times when you want to dump money into things like Crypto, which can rise extremely fast during a bullish market.\n\n# Crypto's Correspondence With the Stock Market\n\nThe Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market, especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a downtrend in the general economy. That is basically the reason we saw another dip in Crypto's prices today.\n\n**TLDR**: The Fed will be tightening its monetary policies due to inflation and the stock market has started to crash. With the stock market starting to go down, we're already seeing the Crypto market react today, and unfortunately if the general market continues to dip, so will Crypto.",

    "postText": "If you want to join me in watching metamask account get robbed by some asshole look below My metamask wallet number is 0xc97603fc31d6e96C2A145EC44B369d5263470279\n\nSome bustard who tricked me into clicking on a dodgy link (pretending to be tech support for SNX on discord) has taken half my wallet so far (about $130k). The rest is still there but disappearing slowly in front of my eyes.\n\nYou can see all the transactions from this morning how he/she is cleaning up.\n\nUnfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything I can do other than jumping on the occasional ETH transfer they are making in so I can sweep it out.\n\nThe only reason I haven't shared my secret phrase with the whole world is a quiet hope I might one day get it back. But if  that's never going to happen maybe I should share it with you all. After all it would amuse me if someone else steals it before @scofield#0471 takes it all.....\n\nEDIT: \n\nI can see people asking why am I not moving the coins out. The answer is I really, really, really tried. \nHowever there seems to be script which instantly transfer the coins to a different wallet, no matter what I type in for gas fees or the address. So far I failed on ALCX, on YFI, on SLP, on AAVE - so I have given up as I don\u2019t know what to do a setting up a script myself is beyond my abilities. Whenever I add in ETH, all it does is makes its easier to the bastard to take my coins. So all I can literally do is watch right now.\n\nSECOND EDIT\n\nI was sent a link to a site which was going to validate my MM extension. The site looked real enough that I clicked on it and entered my security phrase. That was where I suddenly blew up 6 years worth of HODLing in one go\u2026.\n\nTHIRD EDIT\n\nNormally I am hyper sensitive to security and very very wary of online support from strangers. However, due to a rare combination of sleep deprivation from staying up late to watch the Euro 2020 final, and not paying attention when I should have I made the fatal error of falling for what is now obviously a elaborate con. I\u2019m so used to clicking approve on Defi sites to connect to wallets that my guard has as down and this looked genuine enough.\n\nBy the time I realised what was happening it was too late. I logged into MM from a MacBook as my original wallet was on pc, but it made no difference. They initially took 8 ETH, some sushi and old GNT I forgot to convert. With no gas fees the raid stopped. So I thought I would be quick and add a little gas and try and take some out. That didn\u2019t work - no matter what I big in gas fees it was either immediately outbid (lost my aave and STETH) or accepted and went to another wallet which I didn\u2019t recognise (lost my ALCX there). Later the fucker started liquidating my assets and put gas in to do this. I managed - and this was through the most frantic clicking and accepting any fucking gas bid at the highest price  to transfer out the ETH to a separate wallet. I managed to get some out which slowed the attacks as there was no ETH to pay for the gas. This would happen every hour and I managed to get about 0.05 ETH LOL \n\nThis was totally my mistake and not due to SNX, who to be fair, warn you not to do what I did. But I was tired, had sent a message to their tech support sub and instead of reading the warning, ignored it like a noob so yeah - I own this and it\u2019s my fault.\n\nTo those of you who think this is fake, I hope it never happens to you. I had to take a day off work to watch this slow motion disaster - I am sitting with a sick feeling, with pounding chest and periodically start tearing up which I can only assume is a slow motion panic attack. I have told my wife who is understandably shocked. When it all goes, I get to tell the rest of family that I got fucked over through ONE SINGLE LAPSE OF JUDGEMENT.\n\nI posted this as a warning to the bulk of the community who could just as easily have fallen for the same\n\nI used to look down on exchanges but they all look safer as least they have 2FA which MM lacks.\n\nI\u2019m pretty much done now with believing crypto will only change the world for the better and for the first time have been thinking, bring on more fucking regulation and make every wallet linked to an ID  - that way one day I can find out the bastard who cleaned me out and will spend what I have left on justice.\n\nFOURTH EDIT\n\nThank you so much to everyone for their sympathy and support. To those of you telling me I\u2019m dumb /stupid / foolish for so much holding on MM, thank for the comments but after the first 100 I stopped reading them as they get dull quickly. It was a mistake to leave so much on MM and with hindsight, the fact that my ledger wasn\u2019t letting me connect to some Defi sites was an obvious flag rather than an obstacle.\n\nSo since this afternoon, I was recommend the flashbots service on discord by some of you. With some (read massive) trepidation about using discord again, I posted my details and one of their whitehat guys Alex got in touch. \n\nI won\u2019t give all the details for now as he\u2019s still on the case but he already rescued just over 40 steth that was staked on curve as a ETH/STETH LP pool. I\u2019m overjoyed as that\u2019s $85k that I had written off now back (and in a ledger before any of you ask).\n\nI\u2019m hopeful as to what happens to the remaining $35k but it already feels like a fuck you to the thief.\n\nThanks to those of you who told me some of my stolen money may have gone to kraken, I\u2019m messaging them so I hope they can freeze the money and if I\u2019m lucky even help ID the counterpart (not holding my breath though as I don\u2019t know ifs it\u2019s real and whether they will help or not).\n\nWith respect to the site I clicked on, DM if you really want to know but I left it off here in case someone else clicks on it and makes the same mistake I did. I\u2019ve got in touch with the domain hosts to ask for their help in identifying the thief.\n\nObviously it not the best day in the world but feels a hell of a lot better than it did a few hours ago.\n\nFIFTH and hopefully final edit\n\nThank you to everyone who has sent positive messages of support, both below and in the chat. They have really helped, especially at the start when I was super stressed with indescribable feeling of watching my account get emptied in front of my eyes and being powerless to do anything about it. The (useful) advice from people was helpful and I am especially thankful that the flashbots teams was recommended.\n\nAlex has been been awesome. After he verified that the account was actually mine he stepped to stop the bleed (and I appreciated the fact that both the groups on discord and even this sub want to fact-check this to make sure it\u2019s not a scam or a lie to flame someone). He set up a burner to remove incoming ETH which meant the thief couldn\u2019t take more as there was no gas on the account. He then started to work on moving out the remaining coins to a safe wallet. At the time of writing he\u2019s retrieved 117k from the 120k that was left (using this mornings prices). There\u2019s a bit left which will hopefully come over but given how much was taken this am, that\u2019s a rounding error on what I lost. For those of you who need his details DM or wait as I\u2019ll edit one last time and add his Twitter account when this is all over and I\u2019m calm. He has been amazing and whilst they ask for a modest fee it\u2019s well worth it.\n\nThanks to Kraken for reaching out and apologies to SNX if it looked like I was blaming them for my mistake. Hopefully Kraken can help but I\u2019m also going to message a lot of the other exchanges too - anything I can do to make the money hard to get for the thief will make me happy and maybe it might even get him caught (but really not holding my breath on that).\n\nFor those of you who keep wondering (1) no, I am not doing this for moon farming as making a few dollars and getting karma in no way makes up for a hit, (2) this isn\u2019t a new account. I\u2019ve been on Reddit for years but am usually silent as the chats can get poisonous quickly, (3) even I knew it was risky leaving so much on a hot wallet but I have used MM for a long time and found Ledger to be challenging with some Defi. I really wish I had been more careful but that\u2019s done. I don\u2019t blame anyone other than myself and the bastard who stole my coins but wish MM had 2FA which would have killed this or a way to hard freeze your account instantly which again would stop the bleed and work out a recovery and (4) for all of you who are sitting on your high horse lecturing me on how dumb this is and why you should never use your private data online - I fully understand and agree with your point of view, as YESTERDAY I would have been like YOU safe in the knowledge that nothing like this would ever happen to ME\u2026..\n\nIt\u2019s been a hell of day but I\u2019ll be fine with time.\n\nSIXTH AND FINAL EDIT\n\nOkay so it been a surreal 24 hours. For those of you who want the full sequence of events it\u2019s basically this.\n\nI have a few different accounts but started using MetaMask heavily in recent months. Basically because Argent was heavy in gas prices and my ledger didn\u2019t always connect to some of the DEFI sites I stitched to MM. Thanks to a run up in crypto market valuations, and some small trades and staking, the $20k was playing with 6 months ago in the hot wallet had became around $250-260k yesterday.\n\nMy first mistake was leaving such a large amount on MM. In fact I had been actively considering moving some of it but with hindsight waited too too long. At times gas prices on ETH have been insane and was my pure bad luck that yesterday was one of the cheapest days around where tx were a few dollars rather than $20-70 which I\u2019d seen in previous weeks. Trying to save a few hundred bucks turned out to be a very bad decision.\n\nWith hindsight, I wish I had got up and gone to work and the worst that would have happened would have been feeling deeply disappointed by the England performance the night before.  Instead I went on to make one of the most expensive mistake of my life. \n\nI decided that yesterday I would finally get around to messaging the help desk at the discord chat for SNX and ask if they could help me with some SNX I had deposited there on the L2 wallet. The problem was, that I was able to see the amount of SNX on their Optimism mainnet which showed SNX token only but not but not my ETH, whilst the Ethereum mainnet showed my ETH and other alts but not the SNX tokens.\n\nI went to the sub and asked for help in the chat. Got no response and tried a bit later. That time I got 3 people replying in private chats each claiming to be from SNX. Whilst the SNX sub warns against this, I was tired and assumed that maybe it was like some of the other subs where people can advise you if the mods are busy.\n\nTo my misfortune I replied to the scammer explaining the problem. He basically told me my MM wallet wasn\u2019t syncing back to the network and I should validate it. That sounded plausible given I couldn\u2019t see my total balances and also in recent weeks I\u2019ve faced a glitch as time where the wallet balance comes up a zero for up to a minute when I first open it so thought maybe he\u2019s right.\n\nTo help, he sent a link to quite a detailed looking site which looked real enough and unfortunately, thanks to weeks of linking random DEFI sites to my MM wallet  I had become unfortunately desensitised to connecting to random pages and accepting connections to my wallet\n\nWhen I tried the link on the fake site, it wasn\u2019t working apparently so Scammer suggested I try again. This time, I figured maybe I should try the option to connect to my wallet by entering my private pass phrase. \n\nYes I know it was dumb NOW\n\nYes I realise it\u2019s my fault.\n\nI\u2019ll live with this expensive mistake for a long time.\n\nA strange set of events in which I was super tired, not nearly alert enough and my warning radar was off meant I went for the most basic and simple phishing scam. To those of you on your high horses laughing about how this can never happen to you - good luck and I hope you carry on living perfect lives in which you never make a mistake.\n\nA few mins pass as the scammer is still engaged on the discord chat explaining it will take some time. He then causally asks me if I have a ledger and want to sync that too\u2026.\n\nAt that instant, I suddenly realise what I\u2019ve done and get a cold sweat. Why the fuck should he ask that unless\u2026.\n\nI check my MM wallet on zapper.fi and see that the wallet balance has suddenly dropped. I\u2019m now missing $20k and a quick check shows my 8 ETH, some sushi and some Golem which I had are gone. \n \nI start to get super angry that I\u2019ve lost 8 coins. After a few mins I calm down and suddenly realise that the only reason I haven\u2019t lost more is there is now zero ETH on my account so no way to do more transactions.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that he must have set up a copy of my wallet on his pc and started emptying it out. At this stage I\u2019m becoming less angry about what\u2019s gone and becoming deeply worried about the rest.\n\nI send frantic emails to MM which aren\u2019t answered until late in the evening and the next morning (which basically tell me there is nothing that can be done in my case and be more careful next time - thanks guys, will never be using you again.)\n\nAt this point, the major weakness of MM finally hits me. Forget the convenience, if all goes wrong I have literally NO way to stop any transactions (hell they don\u2019t even show in my wallet but I can see them on zapper) or freeze the account. Consensys may have built a nice chrome extension but it\u2019s useless if there\u2019s a problem. \n\nAt some point I look up and see that more of my coins are disappearing. 20 odd STETH suddenly disappearing is especially painful. I check on zapper and can see he is putting in ETH to put up gas fees to move stuff off the Defi sites and liquidating my coins and moving them out. Now I\u2019m actively watching the account on zapper. Whenever I saw ETH come in I tried to first move the coins to my ledger but every single time it just goes to another unknown wallet. WTF? I eventually understand that they have copied my account on a different pc and are probably running a script to automatically outbid me. I had watched my one YFI go - that hurt as I had spent a BTC on it lol. I watched my 104 ALCX go - another 15 ETH gone in smoke. \n\nMy whole accounts looks fucked and all I can literally do is watch\u2026.\n\nAround this point I send my first panicked message to Reddit that I was down 130k and likely to lose the whole lot. I figure maybe between the likely ridicule and crap I will get, maybe I will get lucky with some help. \n\nIn the meantime all I can do is try to run slight interference by trying to move some of the ETH that the thief was adding to another account. Strangely moving ETH to another wallet appears to be the only coin I could impact. When I can moved it I try and run a tx and cancel it with a high gas fee to disrupt the ETH balance and screw up his transfers. This slows the bleeding but it\u2019s not over and I don\u2019t know what I can do. I read messaged here about trying other pcs, logging out of MM, I try it all and it does no good and makes me more stressed that the scammer might be stealing more when I\u2019m not watching.\n\nWhen I first posted on Reddit I was down about half with the remaining amount staked on curve (alcx/ETH LP, zrx/ETH LP, ETH/stETH LPs) which was around 120k. Don\u2019t know why they were last to go but thank god they were there.\n\nIn between the usual trolls and assholes calling me a liar, there were messages of support and some very helpful suggestions on then flashbots discord sub (initially sent to me by the SNX subs).\n\nI messaged flashbots and Alex from there got in touch. I gave him full info and access to my ex to verify it was mine). Even he commented that I shouldn\u2019t do this (lost track of how many times I heard that yesterday) but as my account was already compromised I had to trust it would be okay as without it he couldn\u2019t do anything.\n\nHe explained that he would first set up a burner so any ETH coming in would be immediately burned leaving no gas for transfers. This was quickly set up which closed the gate on the thief for the short term. \n\nFor those of you checking the wallet history you can see some incoming ETH which then immediately is removed - that scammer\u2019s ETH he\u2019s wasting now. I didn\u2019t want to alert him as to what was happening, so there was minimal mentions of this on my posts to Reddit, which I was still checking as this forum sometimes has some very useful feedback and suggestions.\n\nOver the next 8 hours Alex managed to move the remaining balance to a hard wallet and basically recovered all of my remaining balance minus some dust and dai staked on alchemix which I can\u2019t get back so it\u2019s all there which was around 117k out of 120k. I don\u2019t know how he did it - if you really want to know go to discord and ask him - but I am overjoyed that he did what he did. It\u2019s amazing for both his stepping in and spending hours to save this and no less for his 100% total honesty and integrity. If he had moved the coins elsewhere and told me it was the original thief I would never have known.\n\nIn the end I\u2019ve lost about 55 ETH and saved about the same (values were all over the place as the market tanked in the evening).\n\nI didn\u2019t post for moons or karma. I posted as a warning and for help and I\u2019m glad I did. I would never have found the courage to trust flashbots without it. I would not have been alerted to the scammer using Kraken to deposit the stolen coins.\n\nTo those of you who offered financial support/crypto/gofundme, thank you so much but there is really no need. Alex has saved a big chunk and I will be alright. Losing this amount of coins thanks to a scam is painful but if I couldn\u2019t stomach large swings I wouldn\u2019t have held on for years - if I can live through a few 80% drawdowns in BTC and ETH and recover, then I\u2019ll come back from this okay (however for a while I will stop measuring my crypto value in $ rather than #coins lol).\n\nThank you very much to everyone who offered emotional support and well wishes. They are very much appreciated and more than make up for the large number of trolls and morons who like to throw around shit. Please don\u2019t worry about me. My wife, whilst initially shocked and upset, is fully supportive and I have every confidence I will do really well (especially after EIP 1559 and later ETH 2.0)\n\nTo the libertarians, outraged that I\u2019ve swung to side of more regulation, I want to say that I still believe that you should do what you want - legally. It doesn\u2019t have to be totally anonymous - hell half the problem with the current version of the internet is anonymous trolls venting lies and crap everywhere. \n\nFor crypto to go truly mainstream you need some degree of safety and the ability to follow up and prosecute crimes. Watching some c*** screw me over in real time was an infuriating and humbling experience and definitely made me resent the anonymity of the scammer\u2026..\n\nBTW for those of you who go on about being your own bank good luck and come back to the real world where actual banks are regulated and safe (unlike the current Wild West of crypto Defi) and remember many of us don\u2019t want to be our own bank. I never thought about being my own bank and bought coins like ETH for other reasons. I like the blockchain and the crypto space as they are exciting and disruptive ideas that will hopefully make a new version of the internet in due course and change the world. However like the internet 2.0, no matter how it starts, eventually governments will step in and more regulation is coming. \n\nMr scammer, I\u2019ve already reported you to a bunch of exchanges where you seem to be staking your stolen coins and even if I can\u2019t get you immediately, your records are permanently there on the blockchain and one day you will be fucking found\u2026.\n\nFinally thanks again to Alex!\n\nFor those of you who asked about him, his Twitter handle is @amanusk_\n\nCheck him out, he\u2019s a true legend and a gent.",

    "postText": "TITAN was at $60 two days ago, now it's at $0.00000003. Here's why you shouldn't YOLO in (and yes it's market cap) TITAN's crash was really absurd, I personally haven't seen anything this extreme yet. It crashed almost 100% in a few hours and now sits at 0.00000005% of its ATH. That's something. I've seen many people in the past two days ask stuff like: \"sure, it won't recover from that. But what if I just invest like $10, if it goes back to even just one cent, a tiny fraction of the ATH, that would be a ton of money!\"\n\nAnd yes, it absolutely would be! And that alone should be enough to tell you that it can't be this easy. The thing is: because of how that whole network works, a lot of TITAN was printed when it crashed.\n\n10 days ago, the circulating supply was 116 million. Now it's 34 **trillion**, or 34,000 billion, or 34,000,000 million. Yeah, that's a lot. So let's consider the market cap, which is:\n\n**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**\n\nA coin price of 1 cent would mean a market cap of 344 billion, putting it on the #2 spot, higher than ETH. At 2 cents it would get close to BTC, at 5 cents its market cap would be higher than all other crypto combined.\n\nOn iron.finance, the creators of the coin state \"WARNING: Please don't buy TITAN or IRON.\". Listen to them. This coin doesn't have a chance to go up again and as always, coin price is a bad indicator, even if it used to be higher.",

    "postText": "ETH is bad, and I am tired of pretending it's not. I am going to open up by saying that some of the following is going to be FACT and some of it will be OPINION. However, the opinion will never prevail over the facts. Also, depending on traction I may do a second post with some more up to debate things.  \nI also know that the title alone will lead to downvotes, some of you won\u2019t even read it before downvoting. It is a shame that people forgot downvotes are supposed to be used to penalize off-topic and not to punish unpopular opinions, not to create echo chambers.    \nSo let\u2019s get to it shall we?   \n\n**ETH is shady:**  \nNot only is ETH a security, it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes. The connections between the ETH Foundation, ConsenSys, and the SEC are totally public knowledge. \nJay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell.    \nJoe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.   \nConsenSys is a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.  \nThat was the back door ETH used to get the free pass on regulations.  \nThere are court papers about the meetings between ConsenSys and the SEC.  \nAt the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.  \nHinman\u2019s, Clayton\u2019s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.  \nThe plan by ConsenSys with the help of the SEC was clearly to make ETH the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with SEC lawsuits.   \nAt the same time this was happening, Gary Gensler told an MIT audience that \u201cXRP deserved regulatory clarity\u201d.  (I won\u2019t go in depth with the Ripple lawsuit here).  \nNot only is Chairman Gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire SEC trying to hide the fact they gave ETH a free pass, to date ETH is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security.   \nOther funny \u201ccoincidences\u201d include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman\u2019s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled. Hinman receiving $15 Million, during his service on the SEC, from  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett. AND after leaving the SEC, Hinman returned to  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett as a senior crypto adviser.  \n\n**ETH is centralized:**  \nUsers and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it\u2019s head, but we can\u2019t forget ETH falls under this group.  \nThe first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.    \nThe second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.  \nThis leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don\u2019t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.  \nEvery hard fork the Ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. You know what that looks like? Our current banking system. Where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit.  \nPeople in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can Ethereum upon it\u2019s users.    \nTo quote one of my sources \u201cEtherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can\u2019t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.\u201d  \n  \n**ETH recent and future design is bad:**  \nEveryone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.  \nThis change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.   \nBurning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.  \nBut the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. If you want ETH to be useful, you need to, well, use it. But this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. Users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit.  \nTaking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. If you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways.   \nAnd since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. An interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? Bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently.\nWell, given ETH\u2019s history, you know how those chips would fall. Even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players.  \nAnd PoS will only make this whole process more straight forward. The fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system.    \n\n**In conclusion:**    \nETH\u2019s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.    \nAt any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don\u2019t matter. Your nodes don\u2019t matter.  \nETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.    \nDon\u2019t be fooled.\n\n**Sources:**  \nhttps://tomerstrolight.medium.com/the-problem-with-ethereum-af9692f4af95\nhttps://www.crypto-law.us/the-ethereum-free-pass-fair-notice-and-the-fight-ahead/\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/ethereums-design-choices-are-inherently-political/  \n  \n  \nEDIT: I was enjoying the discussion in the comments, but I am getting spam downvoted so I will have to stop.

    "postText": "On may 24th CEO of one of the largest bank in the world - HSBC publicly said that crypto lacks transparency and later it's UK branch started to block payments to Binance. Yesterday same British HSBC branch has been fined \u00a363.9m by the UK's financial regulator for money laundering! This is the clear example of hypocrisy at its finest! Seven month before their CEO Noel Quinn publicly announced that HSBC will not be offering any services related to Bitcoin and crypto entirely to its users and linked his decision to the \"lack of transparency\" and high volatility in the cryptocurrency industry. As per Quinn, it is impossible for an agency to tell who owns the crypto, and hence everything depends on whether the holders can be \"trusted in regard to market integrity.\"  \n\nAnd yesterday karma hit them back, the same fucking swindlers are fined \u00a364m for anti-money laundering failings. Actually, initially they were fined for  \u00a391m  though since HSBC not disputed the findings and agreed to settle it was cut down to \u00a363.9m. HSBC's failings cover a period of eight years, from 2010 to 2018, the FCA said.\n\n[**The FCA's report into HSBC**](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/decision-notices/hsbc-bank-plc.pdf) cites examples of poor controls, including failing to spot suspicious activity on the account of a construction director who also played a leading role in a criminal gang trying to steal millions of pounds by setting up fake companies. The person pleaded guilty to VAT fraud and went to prison. HSBC also failed to detect a customer imprisoned for smuggling cigarettes into the UK and ordered to pay \u00a31.2m by the HMRC tax office, where the bank missed \"a sustained period of unusual activity,\" the FCA said.  \n\n\nFor those who did not know, in 2012 after an investigation by the US Department of Justice the same bank paid $1.9bn fine (\u00a31.4bn) for laundering money of Mexican drug cartels, circumventing the rules designed to prevent dealings with Iran, Burma, North Korea and being financed by terrorists from Middle East. \n\nSo dump fucking HSBC shares if you have any and buy crypto and if you wonder, yeah this is financial advice.",

    "postText": "I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers. As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.\n\nNow I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have \"clicked\" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.\n\n1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )\n2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.\n3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.\n4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.\n5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your \"HODL\" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.\n6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.\n7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on \"must have\" telegram groups.\n8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.\n9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).\n10. Always have an idea as to what the current \"climate\" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is \"hot\" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.\n11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the \"hot\" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.\n12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even \"airdrop farming\" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance \"dust\" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income\n13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work\n14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.\n15. Have an \"emergency reserve\".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.\n16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.\n17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.\n18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).\n19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a \"bag\" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one \"Gem\" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and \"catch them all\".\n20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a \"bitcoin genius teenager\" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)\n21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a \"rug-pull\"?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned \"immunity to rug-pulls\".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.\n22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!\n23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.\n24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't \"make it\" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The \"will you make it?\" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.\n\nAnyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",

    "postText": "20% dip? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Looks pretty normal to me. It's April 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s making around 1.1 BTC each day. The price is crossing $2. \n\nIt's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.\n\nIt's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. \n\nNovember 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.\n\nWe crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.\n\nIt's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.\n\nBy April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.\n\nIt's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. \n\nNow it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.\n\nIt's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. \n\nIt's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.\n\nIt's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.\n\nIt's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: \"\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..\"...\n\nActually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is \"crash\".\n\nEther went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.\n\nIt's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my \"How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx\" spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.\n\nIt's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.\n\nBitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.\n\nIt's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.\n\nIt's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.\n\nIt's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing. My family on Mars send me some DOGE to keep me afloat. Ripple is still being investigated by the SEC while their owners siphon another $100m each year. The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.\n\nIt's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.\n\nIts the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. Instead, I do whatever I am doing now. I give up and decide to post this so I can use the reddit app to check if anyone has posted anything meaningful about NuCypher, even though I expect the usual pump posts.",

Nobody knows what is happening, don't come to this sub for advice. Since the crash in May, the bipolarity of this sub has become even worse than before. Yesterday, when most coins dipped quite a bit, the sentiment was that clearly we were already in a bear market and there was no chance of things going up again in the short term.\n\nToday, after most coins recovered from yesterday's dip, the top posts are providing us \"[the FULL picture](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o62yg9/the_full_picture_why_i_believe_the_crypto_bull/)\" (lol) why the bull market isn't over and are congratulating us on not having paper hands.\n\nThe facts are: nobody knows what will happen. The only thing we know is that things went up like crazy for half a year, then crashed pretty hard in May and have been going sideways ever since. The market could continue to go sideways for months, or it could shoot back up or completely crash in an hour. Looking at former cycles doesn't help us all that much, nothing is guaranteed to repeat itself.\n\nThis sub is a great source of entertainment and for crypto news, it is an awful source of advice. People like to pretend they know what will happen - and I think some really think they know it and are telling that to themselves - because they read it in the stars (and call it technical analysis) or just look at some metrics that support their claims and ignore others. Don't believe them, nobody knows anything.\n\n**tl;dr: nobody knows what will happen, don't believe anyone who pretends they do**",

    "postText": "If Jake Paul is only fined $400,000 for a crypto scam that nets him millions, where is the deterrence from doing it again!? Jake Paul has created and shilled multiple projects like Dink Doink and Cryptozoo which eventually led to the SEC fining home almost half a million dollars. This is good in theory, the SEC is protecting investors by giving a fine to fraudsters. But if you take even one second to go over the numbers he still wins.\n\nJake Paul netted millions from cryptozoo alone and his coworkers made just as much. His other scam projects such as DINK DOINK was another rug pull he cashed in on. If he is profiting 6x or more than his fine it\u2019s really no punishment whatsoever, hardly a slap on the wrist.\n\nThe only real punishment was that it hurts his reputation. But the real issue I have with this is that tells other potential scammers that they have the green light. They can go ahead and commit mass fraud because at the end of the day you just have to pay a little tax on your profits. And retail investors lose again.\n\nThe SEC can\u2019t seem to make one right move in the crypto world but I can\u2019t even blame them fully because of all the influencers and celebrities are the ones doing it in the first place.

I have shared it with some smaller communities, and there was some great feedback on it regarding the main concern - what if Elon tweets: \"Bitcoin is too high imo\" and the bot buys at the wrong time.\n\nSo I found an API that would help me analyse the tweet sentiment, and integrated this into the code. The bot will now only buy Bitcoin when Elon Tweets, if the sentiment of his tweet is positive.\n\nI have tested the functionality and the bot is quite stable, but I haven't tested how profitable (if at all) it would actually be, so if you're interested in testing it, please share the results with us! :)\n\nThe bot was built mostly for fun, and I wouldn't encourage you to trade with it on a live account!

The U.S. is one of the world\u2019s two largest economies and the center of the English-speaking world. It has the power to tax, the strongest network of alliances and the most powerful military. Yes, it has printed a lot of dollars since 2008, but it also has [taken steps](https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2013/march/federal-reserve-interest-balances-reserves/) to lower the speed at which those dollars circulate.\n\nYes, rates of price inflation are likely to be higher for the next two years or so, but already some of the immediate inflationary pressures are abating; lumber prices, for instance, are now [plummeting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-11/lumber-prices-post-biggest-ever-weekly-drop-with-buyers-balking?sref=EP6bV7CS). Over a 10-year time horizon, the U.S. government can [borrow](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us) at a near-zero real rate of interest, hardly a sign of a doomed empire.\n\nNor is the U.S. government about to go broke or on the brink of resorting to hyperinflation. The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio may well hit 200%, but the poorer and smaller nation of Japan is doing OK with similar debt levels. Keep in mind that national wealth, while difficult to estimate, may run as much as six to eight times higher than GDP. So a 200% debt-to-income ratio could mean a debt-to-wealth ratio as low as 25%. That\u2019s hardly the end of the world. Think of how comfortable you\u2019d be if you paid off \u201conly\u201d 75% of your mortgage.\n\nIf anything, crypto is more likely to hurt the currencies of countries that are doing very poorly, [such as Venezuela](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-adoption-venezuela-research). Fiat currency won\u2019t just go away, so over the long run crypto could actually boost the value of the dollar by stifling the rise of potential competitors.

So let them decide what\u2019s logical to them *now***.**\n\nIf you\u2019re itching to share, then talk about it like a passion or hobby. Share the fundamentals: what it\u2019s trying to solve; how it made an impact; what you\u2019ve learned: what you\u2019re excited about, share the good and the bad. Most of all, share with **zero expectations** that they\u2019ll invest or even care. \n\nIf you really believe in the value of cryptocurrency\u2014the gains, opportunities, tech, and values\u2014then let it speak for itself. It doesn\u2019t need evangelists, it isn\u2019t a religion; it\u2019s a show, so grab your popcorn and sit the hell down!",

    "postText": "'White Hat hacker' saves Coinbase from possible catastrophe In the nick of time, a gigantic crisis for the major US crypto exchange Coinbase was recently prevented. A \"white hat hacker\", a hacker with good intentions, came across a major vulnerability and instead of exploiting it, he notified the team at Coinbase. Coinbase was able to fix the vulnerability in no time and publicly thanked the hacker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coinbase white hat hacker**\n\nThe hacker in question is known on social media as \"Tree of Alpha. On Twitter a few days ago, he let it be known that he wanted to get in touch with Coinbase's dev team urgently. As it turns out, he was on to something important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwxdw9tslnh81.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb2656648a26deda4b43ae70b910e40a6a1897e2\n\nJust a few hours later, Coinbase announced that they had temporarily suspended all trading on the Advanced Trading platform under the guise of \"technical problems. Moments later, the problems had been resolved, Tree of Alpha itself confirmed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lebw2nrvlnh81.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=284d1621fd230e44f073a1e9cd0a99714497f409\n\nAccording to Tree of Alpha, the problems could have potentially caused a real catastrophe for Coinbase and the rest of the crypto industry. Indeed, the vulnerability allowed malicious parties to manipulate all Coinbase order books with fake prices. Of course, the consequences of such an exploit would have been huge, not only for the crypto exchange, but for the overall crypto industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coinbase CEO Brian Armstong**\n\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has since publicly thanked Tree of Alpha. According to him, the hacker's willingness to warn Coinbase instead of exploiting the vulnerability himself once again shows what the crypto community really stands for. It is unknown if Tree of Alpha received a reward for his achievements. This is often the case within the crypto industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/teqaits0mnh81.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=3506ad02e6a57ef323d5ff0b8ebed9b75fc48ab2\n\nAt least Coinbase can count itself lucky that it ended with a bang.",

That, or more developers begin looking at building on networks with lower gas fees as their TVL grows, though none are anywhere close to Ethereum\u2019s at the moment.\n\nHow does everyone feel about gas at the moment, and where we will be a year or two later?

After reading some understandably angry comments I've learned a little more about them and how they leverage the Ethereum Network for scalability while protecting decentralization, though I'm nowhere near qualified to comment on the tech.*\n\n*I guess my main point was that many of the more desirable or attractive projects or games (current and upcoming) are housed on L1 and are what currently draws new user interest, only for them to be turned away by the gas fees that first-timers are almost certainly going to be taken aback by. Considering present circumstances, that's just not great for new adopters, though I'm sure it'll level out sometime in the future.*",

Don't! **EDIT: read the post before you shill your sub-$1-coins, please, why does nobody do this today?**\n\nI always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days:\n\n*\"what are the best coins under $X?\"*\n\nAnd sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?\n\nLol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all. Because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. There are currently about 18,700,000 BTC in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. The important figure is the market cap, which is\n\n**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**\n\nSo, for example, for BTC it would be  49,500 X 18,700,000, about 920 billion USD. So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not. If 1 BTT would be worth 49,500, as 1 BTC currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be almost 50,000,000,000,000,000. 50 quadrillion, or 50,000 trillion. The total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion.\n\n**tl;dr:** Coin price is NOT a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. Check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons. Also remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, like 0.001 BTC and don't have to buy a whole one.",

    "postText": "For the love of god, please learn what market caps are I\u2019m seeing so many people just not have any understanding of one of the most basic measurements of valuation. If you don\u2019t know what \u201cmarket cap\u201d means and you\u2019re trying to get in early on \u201cmoonshots,\u201d I\u2019m begging you to take 2 minutes to read.\n\nMarket capitalization is the total value of all members of an asset. Just circulating supply * price. (Edited note: worth mentioning that you should be using the average price over different platforms. THAT BEING SAID: if the platform you\u2019re looking at shows a price that would imply a market cap in the quadrillions, then that DOES mean the price is too high there. Even though the market cap calculated by that price wouldn\u2019t be an accurate measurement of the combined value of the coin, it IS a good indicator of whether or not it will actually be able to maintain that price. If it\u2019s not an accurate price, arbitrage is going to correct the price soon enough.) \n\nWhat does it tell us? It lets us know how much ~~money~~ value is attributed to it, and how it compares to other coins.\n\n\nTake SHIB for an example. It has a circulating supply of **400 trillion tokens,** so at its price of 0.003\u00a2, it has a market cap of nearly $12 BILLION. That\u2019s 1/5 of doge\u2019s cap of $60B, and it is therefore already one of the largest cryptocurrencies out there.\n\nAt 10\u00a2, the market cap would be $40 trillion, double the US annual GDP. It will not hit 10\u00a2. It will not hit 1\u00a2z It will not hit 0.1\u00a2. It MIGHT hit 0.01\u00a2 because of how the market has been working lately, but those other targets are just mathematically far too high.\n\n(Another edited note: when I say reach that price, I meant having a stable price that high on most/all trading platforms. Thanks to those of you who corrected me on that)\n\nThe creators want you to see all those zeros in front of the price and assume buying it would be \u201cgetting in early.\u201d Don\u2019t let them fool you. You are not getting in early by buying a coin with a $12B market cap. You are almost certainly very very very late.\n\nDYOR. Please.\n\nEdit:\n\nA lot of people are hung up on \u201chow much money is in it.\u201d I didn\u2019t mean it in terms of principal investment, I meant it in terms of valuation. I have a lot of BAT that I bought at 30 cents. I don\u2019t value it as if it were the 30 cents per token that I bought it at, because I know I can just sell at the market price if I need to.\n\nThe argument that it would crash if everyone tired to sell at once is fallacious. It\u2019s valued at what it is and it ISN\u2019T crashing to nothing from everyone selling at once because people aren\u2019t trying to all sell at once. They would rather have the BAT than the $1.30. If they didn\u2019t, they would have sold already.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThink I came off wrong here. Not a financial expert, that much is obvious. I know that things can crash from everyone selling, I was trying to say that everyone selling is BECAUSE they value the coin\u2019s value in fiat/btc/eth/whatever less than they do the coin.\n\nSecond, I know there are flaws in it, as it can\u2019t be instantly converted. I\u2019m not trying to make it out to be some perfect metric of value. My intentions here are solely to tell people that their millions of scamcoin that they bought for $10 probably is not going to make them a 9 figure crypto whale.\n\nEdit 3: u/ReachOutLoud broke down problems with  a lot of my points.

    "postText": "EXPLANATION: The recent crash was probably due to margin accounts having a cascading crash on Binance. Degenerates on Binance with up to 150x leverage (borrowing Tethers to buy crypto) have been building up their margin account balances to big numbers, and when they make money, they double down, and build even bigger positions. Because they're degenerates.\n\nBut when the price dips below a certain point, some degenerates who have these margin accounts are suddenly below their maintenance limits, and they get liquidated. When they get liquidated, Binance will sell your crypto for Tether, and you are left with little to nothing.\n\nSo what happened? Crypto got sold, and Tether got bought. Because Crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements.\n\nThis creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts. It all ends in a very fast, cascading crash like we just saw.\n\nThe bad news is the price is lower, but there's a silver lining. The good news is the market is in a healthier position after this. Most of the unsustainable degenerate margin accounts are probably gone. If we go up to $60k in the next week, it's not because of borrowing (as much). Going forward, at least for the near term, another event like this is not very likely.\n\nThe price we see right now could be thought of as being closer to the \"real\" price which we would have had without the degenerates.\n\nTLDR: Fuck Binance\n\nAnd fuck the rest of the exchanges with 150x leverage bullshit\n\nEDIT: Some people wanted more evidence to support this theory, so I suggest you look at the price differences between the exchanges (Binance vs. Coinbase, for instance) during the crash. You'll notice the exchange with leverage was significantly lower in price, which suggests bots were arbitraging Coinbase down to match it. Additionally, note the Tether price during the crash, which went up to $1.05.\n\n&#x200B;",

If NFTs were in DnD they would be a lawful neutral force, they are not good or evil they are just a tool and being a transparent and open tool it makes them more easy to keep track of.\n\nIf anything NFTs should provide more consumer protection for digital game downloads than the present model of Microsoft being all like \"trust me bra, we got this\" until one day they just remove the game from the store and leave no public evidence that you ever owned it.\n\nHowever, I also 100% guarantee that game companies are going to use this to further monetise the market for pointless crap cosmetics and strip even more out of a game to sell back to the player later.\n\nBut people shouldn't hate the technology, that's like hating the internet because game companies use the internet to download microtransactions, it really makes no sense. Hate the companies and hate the people buying their garbage.",

    "postText": "despite popular believe, crypto is not the best way to secure your financial future, getting a good job is Users in this sub and other crypto subs have this mentality that crypto is the best and only opportunity they have to get ahead financially. This is ridiculous, getting a good job would be far more beneficial, especially if you have a shitty job and can't afford to buy much crypto in the first place. And if you are making 25-40k a year you shouldn't be spending huge chunks of your time looking into or researching crypto. There are people here that claim to have spent hundreds or even thousands of hours on research. And they admit they are also poor... \n\nFirstly, if you are poor it doesn't matter how much research you do, if you cant even afford to invest a grand you will never see returns that will even support you for one year. You are far better off spending the hundreds or thousands of hours learning tech that pays, like getting your ccna, or learning how to program or something like that. If you are really that into tech why haven't you done this? \n\nSecondly let's say you make 35k a year and decide to learn new skills and net a job that pays 75k a year. Your effort has awarded you an extra 40k a year. Crypto will never bring you those kinds of annual returns (unless you are a big player, but big players have good jobs), especially if you are poor (refer to previous paragraph). \n\nSo for those of you that believe this is the ticket to financial freedom and hate your sub 40k a year job stop looking into crypto right now, get some skills and go get a better job.

And at the forefront of these draconian anti-crypto laws that seek to stifle innovation. Multiple reports claim that Yellen has been the person pushing the aggressive laws against Crypto, sandwiched in the Infrastructure bill. Because if the laws pass, it will give her the power to regulate the entire crypto industry. Yellen is the person behind White House's push to favor Sen. Warner's amendment over others. While the entire crypto community has been publicly tying to educate Senators on these laws, she has been making calls behind closed doors trying to arm twist the Senators into bringing in these draconian regulations. \"Shadowy\"\n\nAs it turns out she has also been getting paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. And she is brining in regulation that kills decentralised competitors to banks, who have so far enjoyed near monopoly when it comes to controlling people's finances. \n\nAs Treasury Secretary, she is paid by the US Government to regulate banks - a role that requires the highest standards of ethics and moral turpitude. But she has collected $7m from the same banks that she regulates! Including Citi, Citadel Securities etc. How, without impartiality, can she regulate these banks that are paying her millions of dollars in speaking fees? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[All the payments she received in 2020.

This is nothing but grift. While it is not per se criminal, because she was doing it when she was not a Govt official, but nevertheless these payments were received between her 2 terms as Treasury Secretary. \n\nThe ethical thing for her was to not accept the role of Treasury Secretary in the new Biden Administration, because she was aware she had been paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. But despite all this, she took up the job. clearly indicating her lack of morals and ethics. \n\nShe really needs to STEP DOWN. The crypto community must unite to get such greedy grifters out of public policy for good, if we need to have a fair chance at our decentralised future.",

Even Fidelity allocates 2% to BTC in their flagship Balanced Fund. Lots of people here keep spreading the narrative that El Salvador is \"gambling recklessly\" with people's savings and what not. \n\nReading those posts one would think their entire reserves is now in BTC.\n\nBut the fact is that just 2% of their reserves are even allocated in BTC. \n\n[El Salvador holds around $70m worth BTC](https://bitcointreasuries.net/). This is literally nothing for a country. They hold 1691 BTC, in comparison , Microstrategy and Tesla hold over 120,000 BTC  and 40,000 BTC respectively. \n\n[El Salvador's total foreign exchange reserves is pegged at $3.3 BN](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FI.RES.TOTL.CD?locations=SV)\n\n\n\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/el-salvador/foreign-exchange-reserves\n\n\nLess than 2% of their reserves are in BTC.\n\n[El Salvador holds more in GOLD than in BTC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/bukele-reveals-el-salvadors-gold-reserves-and-benefits-of-bitcoin-over-gold/articleshow/88142021.cms)\n\nAccording to this article, they hold $79m worth GOLD, but just $70m \nworth BTC. \n\n\n\n\n\nPeople are spreading the false narrative as if he has moved the entire supply of reserves to BTC, which is far away from whats going on.\nThey have just been making small purchases over time. They literally bought like 2 BTC in the end of Dec. Peanuts for a country.\n\n\nA 2% allocation in a risky asset class is not a gamble by any means. It is a decent risk reward play for individuals, and countries as well. \n\nIf you consult with a financial advisor, they may suggest a portfolio allocation of 2% towards emerging asset classes like crypto. Infact, thats what Fidelity suggests as well. [Recently, they added a 2% BTC allocation to their flagship All in one Balanced / Growth funds](https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/products/fidelity-to-add-bitcoin-exposure-to-portfolio-funds/). These are mom and pop funds that are held mostly by conservative investors. \n\nIts been around a year since El Salvador announced their Bitcoin Law and around 6 months since it went active. In this period, they have allocated a small portion of their reserves towards BTC. This is not a gamble, but a solid  and well planned asset allocation strategy. Meanwhile, they have already started mining BTC and over time, this industry has the potential to add to their GDP. \n\n\nWhat did people think bitcoin/crypto adoption would be like, one fine day every country across the world will just start accepting BTC out of the blue? Just like that it would become legal tender without any struggle? \n\nThese are small steps and it will be risky. Nothing happened overnight, let alone moving from USD to a decentralised currency like Bitcoin.\n\nIts shameful that people here want adoption of BTC and crypto, but the first time a large sovereign power has tried to adopt BTC, the same people who want crypto adoption go out of their way to attack them with baseless allegations. \n\n> Muhh adoption should be in accordance with my terms, otherwise its not adoption. \n\nThese people are just privileged bottom feeders who want to enjoy success without any risks whatsoever.",

But the gamble those holders took **then** is way underestimated **today** now that everyone knows of it. \n\nThe dozens of other coins that fucked people hard \u2014 don\u2019t make for as good of a one year equation. I took the liberty of going through the **most popular** moonshots posts from a year ago.. to bring you some examples:\n\n- BEYOND PROTOCOL - \u201cbigger than Bitcoin and ETH combined\u201d is the slogan and it was the most popular post in the last year, $1000 a year ago would be worth $647 today \n\n- BabyKrypto - only 47 days old but if you bought $1000 worth when they started advertising it on Moonshots, you\u2019d have $125 today \n\n- $1000 in SHIBAFEVER would have gotten you 77 million coins just a week ago, worth $153 today \n\nAfter this we started getting into rebase tokens where the \u201cprice\u201d doesn\u2019t move they just \u201cadjust\u201d the tokens that you hold, but you can\u2019t sell either so I\u2019d say $1000 into those burned up pretty quickly. \n\n- There\u2019s also Floki Jr, Floki New York, Micro Shiba and Chopper Inu, Catch Doge, Doge back, and Robo Doge that I can\u2019t even find accurate information on.. but I\u2019m guessing those didn\u2019t make many crypto millionaires. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m seeing a lot of posts asking how to jump on a newly listed coin first and where to find them, and I just wanted to say .. I don\u2019t even think those that have held SHIB for a year give themselves enough credit for how big a leap they took. This style of investing breeds a lot more losers than winners, and winners rarely stop there and cash out \u2014 they\u2019re on the hunt for the next opportunity to lose money. \n\n**Do whatever makes you happy \u2014 but I think we need to see more of the whole picture**",

    "postText": "Porn coins will NOT be the next big thing I can't believe that the front page post about porn coins being \"the next big thing\" has been so massively upvoted. Is it being brigaded? Or do people think it's tagged as comedy?\n\nWhy the heck would we need a brand new coin to buy porn? If I wanted anonymity then surely i'd use one of the already existing, perfectly functioning, time-tested privacy coins like XMR, DASH or ZCASH? Why would I want to take the extra steps of going to some dodgy exchange to buy a coin that I can solely use for one thing? It literally makes zero sense\n\nPlus, every single of those coins OP listed is an ERC-20 token. I don't know how many of you are familiar with ethereum gas prices (i'm guessing the majority are) but I don't really feel like paying hundreds of dollars in gas fees just to see Tyrone bang somebody's wife. I make transactions with XMR all the time and end up paying a few cents\n\nUnless i'm missing something here then it's pretty clear that porn coins will NOT be the next big thing",

His kids were not interested in stocks but are hooked onto cryptocurrencies, and the government has to respect that, and develop a positive outlook.  \n\n2. While scams and fraudsters must be cracked down, the general market must be allowed to develop. A working group of SEC, FINCEN, CFTC and other group members are working on identifying scams in this space.\n\n3. When asked if Crypto has any \"intrinsic value\"? - There is an intrinsic value and relation of the value of bitcoin and the cost of mining it. \n\n4. Price of Bitcoin is just one publicly traded company like McDonalds. In comparison, global money supply is 7.6T. And since Bitcoin has been compared to digital gold, value of all gold in the world is 8T.\n\n\n5. HOLY SHT.. He just mentioned \"HODL\". Hahaha - According to him its \"Hold on for dear life\". \n\n\"We must crack down hard on those who abuse our young enthusiasm for bitcoin and blockchain technology\"\n\n\"We owe it to this new generation, to respect their interest in this new technology with a thoughtful regulatory approach.\"  \n\n----\n\nIn the middle of all this Senator Brown was constantly bashing banks, a topic un-related to all the discussion.

Though the SEC chair addressed that there was not much they could do, but are working with Feds and the treasury. \n\n- \"illegal transactions\" was discussed, and the steps taken to combat misuse of crypto.  \n\n\n\n##Update:  \n\nThis is another Nebraska Legislative hearing on Bitcoin bill which is live now:\n\nhttp://netnebraska.org/interactive-multimedia/government/legislative-hearing-banking-commerce-and-insurance-room-1507-55\n\n",

    "postText": "Everyone always says \u201cDYOR\u201d but never shows you how to DYOR. Here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to doing your own research in the crypto space. ## 1) Initial information gathering and filtering\n\nOnce I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer.\n\n- Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like \"Web 4.0\" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past.\n\n- Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc\n\n- Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account?\n\n- Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?\n\n\n## 2) Fill out an Investment Checklist\n\nI have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:\n\n- What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?\n\n- What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?\n\n- Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?\n\n- What current product exists?\n\n- How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?\n\n- What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?\n\n\n## 3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple\n\nA simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:\n\n- Metcalfe's Law which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic.\n\n- Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply.\n\n- If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price.\n\nOnce you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.\n\nOnce you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how \"smart money\" does it.\n\n## Think about your portfolio allocation\n\nYou should think first in broad terms how you allocate between \"safe\" and \"speculative\" cryptos. For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC and ETH. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.\n\nYou should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:\n\n- Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum\n- Smart contracts platform segment - Ethereum, Polkadot, ALGO, Solana \u2026etc\n- Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash \u2026etc\n- Finance/Bank settlement segment - Stellar ...etc\n- Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain ...etc\n- Promising/Innovative Tech segment: NANO, ADA, Tezos ...etc\n\nYou should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a techie who loves the technology behind a coin, invest in that.\n\n\n## Think of your \"circle of competence\"\n\nThis is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain will achieve adoption? \n\nThis where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every category and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well.\n\n\n## Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets\n\nIf you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThere is no tldr haha.

    "postTitle": "A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Wallets",
    "postText": "A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Wallets A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...\n\n# Why do you need a wallet?\n\nThere's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **\"Not your keys, not your coins.\"** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. \n\nSo you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**\n\nYour **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. \n\nYour **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. \n\nSee, it's not that complicated, is it?\n\n# About wallet types\n\nThere are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. \n\n**Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** \\- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. \n\n**Mobile Wallet** \\- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.\n\n**Desktop Wallet** \\- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.\n\n**Paper wallet** \\- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.\n\n# The Best Hardware Wallets\n\n**Ledger Nano (S and X)** \\- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. \n\nBeware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. \n\n**Trezor (One and Model T)** \\- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.\n\nDespite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.\n\n# The Best Desktop Wallets\n\n**Exodus** \\- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. \n\n**Atomic** \\- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\nOf course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!\n\n**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.\n\nLast piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from \"Binnance\", crazy bonus links from \"Coimbase\", etc.)\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to let us know!",

My karma may take a hit for saying this but idc, mass adoption at ANY COST is not acceptable, we cannot sacrifice decentralization for adoption if it means giving up control to governments and institutions. ETFs are a perfect example, you thought \"oh a BTC ETF it's cool because theres no option to short BTC\" well a week later they can now short BTC with the second BTC ETF. Regulations are the same type of double edged sword that may help people get comfortable with adopting crypto but gives the government immense power over the market.

I basically made a coin like the squid game coin as it looks great but I can only sell a very small amount at a time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the token page on viperswap ](https://preview.redd.it/a0z3yqiv50281.png?width=1871&format=png&auto=webp&s=7914382e82bc3086477d70c5fe2bcd6160cded54)\n\nSo if you head on over to a website called [https://tokenJenny.one](https://tokenJenny.one) then you are able to create your own tokens on the Harmony ONE network. It will cost a little ONE in gas to mint the crypto I used [https://cryptoroyale.one](https://cryptoroyale.one) to make some ROY sent it to MetaMask and then trade that for ONE in [https://viperswap.one](https://viperswap.one)  Done now I have made my first crypto and I add it to ViperSwap so I can add liquidity. With this first crypto I added liquidity in ONE at a 1 to 1 basis then I used 0.01 or 0.001 ONE at a time to buy my crypto for roughly 100 transactions this ups the price a little and so I leave the coin and over about 2 weeks the market brings it up. I sell a little to recover all that had gone to gas and this crashes my crypto to a very low price. Next test is creating coins that add liquidity too each other here's a glimps at them all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[6 Different cryptos all given liquidity too each other and given value form the Liquidity in ONE or USDC  \\(two named KWP lol\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xlsi41lf90281.png?width=1843&format=png&auto=webp&s=689c7ba22351bbc1b79de004631fd59c920951b2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[In doing this I have managed to add about 20 ONE into liquidity of ONE and my KWP coin and now can sell about 250 of KWP at a time, this is what happens when you do sell a little ](https://preview.redd.it/33sse754h0281.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&s=5576fceb2d313db5c17b84520cfcdfe7a03d4333)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see I had a lot of fun creating all of these but none of them really did very well so I then thought well I need to start with a better liquidity ratio so I create notbitcoin I then add 0.0001 to 1 ONE and I buy a few transactions of 0.001 ONE getting less and less NBTC each turn, now I have a value better than I had before so I start to add liquidity from the coins I have made making sure to work out the math on the current values as close as can with a small amount and then bang I add Billions in my own cryptos which soar the Liquidity and the value of the new coin I have made. If I sell any of the coins that I have added this will drop the price dramatically due to me being the only owner.  Plus I can only sell about 0.0002 at a time into ONE due to the low amount of liquidity in this coin and even that small sale would crash the value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts crazy to think this is possible and this just shows you anyone can make crypto and make it look like it has a huge amount of value if I now make sure I buy a little every day and not sell for a few months next year this could be the next doge and will basically follow the market. I could start the trend the not crypto's instead of meme coins. Stay safe all hope this educates you that it really is too easy to make a crypto and just as easy to make one that looks amazing. Hope you all have a great weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: ok this is what I wake up to today\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[210 billion coins in exitance and 2 million value with half a billion in liquidity \\(due to the price\\) work out that market cap :0](https://preview.redd.it/kleo676ka4281.png?width=1869&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea93ab15573e358cf4ca5bb5098cd3bf070faa3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[little update looks like one of the mystery buyers got cold feet lol it was up to 321 Million at its peak](https://preview.redd.it/ujwivnc547281.png?width=1901&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1516a6e2df8fad61bccc55d47e91641f32858ee)",

Russian Ruble - crypto pairs are non-existent today. Also, they cant use that crypto to buy commodities from other countries either, as these countries could come under risk of sanction themselves, and furthermore high volume crypto-commodity market is also non-existent right now. No country is going to be ready to start accepting say 10m  tonnes of Wheat for Crypto. Such a scenario is not even possible right now given the structure of crypto markets.\n\nThat is why it is important for USA to actually build dominance in crypto markets, and yet you have people like Liz spinning up a\"crypto is bad\" narrative whenever they get the chance to do    \n\nBeing afraid of Russia using crypto to evade sanctions is literally being scared of the boogeyman, especially when CIPS and SPFS offer much more immediate options for them.",

Someone made a thread with [this article](https://invezz.com/news/2021/03/12/georgia-passes-a-bill-to-teach-high-school-students-about-crypto/) and a very clickbaity title to entice and get reactions and comments from all of you (obviously for Moon farming).

    "postTitle": "DeFi Explained: The FULL Guide",
    "postText": "DeFi Explained: The FULL Guide I've noticed that people in this sub are getting more and more interested in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications. With this guide I would like to help you getting started with learning the basic fundamentals of DeFi and setting up your wallet and tools. I tried to make this guide as complete as possible.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nLet's start with some fundamentals first.\n\n# What is Decentralized Finance\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is a movement that uses decentralized networks and blockchains to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that work without intermediaries.\n\nCurrently, almost all DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain (EDIT: Binance Smart Chain is NOT as decentralized as Ethereum and is therefore often labeled as CeDeFi). Like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance have a blockchain that acts as a shared ledger in which digital value is tracked. Rather than a central authority, the participants making up the network control the issuance of ether (or BNB), the network's cryptocurrency, in a decentralized way.\n\nDevelopers can program applications that can create, store and manage digital assets, also known as tokens, on the blockchain. For this to work, smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) are written and built. The expiration of these contracts and agreements is automatically enforced if the blockchain receives the correct data. You can make complex, irreversible agreements without the need for an intermediary.\n\nAnyone is able to create, adapt, mix, link or build on an existing DeFi product without permission. DeFi protocols are modular, so they can be stacked on top of each other to build an increasingly dense system of interacting parts.\n\n# Wallets\n\nYou can download a wallet on a PC, tablet or telephone. With this you can store, send or receive Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Three related concepts determine whether someone has ownership of a certain wallet, these are your digital keys (also called public & private keys), your wallet address and your digital signature.\n\nThe most important aspect of a wallet are your digital keys, as they give you access to your wallet. It is important to know that these keys are not stored online on the blockchain but are instead stored independently within the digital wallet itself. Each key consists of both a public key and a private key.\n\nConsider your public key the same as the bank account, which also consists of an address. Your public key works more or less the same. The pin code with which you subsequently gain access to this bank account is then referred to as your private key.\n\nIt is very important that you ALWAYS keep your private key to yourself. If someone else has the private key, he / she can send and steal all coins, so keep it safe. With the public key, people can only send coins, so that can't hurt.\n\nEvery wallet has a unique code, which we also call the wallet address, which consists of a random letter and number combination that is different for everyone. This address is in fact the name of your wallet and makes it possible for others to transfer cryptocurrencies to you.\n\nExample of just any bitcoin address: 14J5Q7ageKhM3miKd94DX44Kf6b7ko4BZe\n\nSome people assume that your public key is the same as your wallet address. This is not entirely true, but the two are mathematically related.\n\nIn order for you to start using DeFi platforms, a browser wallet is needed.\n\n# Coins vs Tokens\n\nA coin runs on its own blockchain, on its own system. It is therefore completely independent. A coin could be compared to a contemporary currency, such as the Dollar. Bitcoin is a coin and has been developed with the aim of serving as a digital payment method and store of value.\n\nThen there are tokens. Tokens by definition do not run on their own blockchain, unlike a coin. They have been added to an already existing blockchain. Tokens can have the same functionality as a coin, although this is not common.\n\nTokens that are created on the Ethereum network are typically ERC-20 tokens. When we talk about ERC20, we mean the standard that is implemented in certain tokens. ERC20 stands for 'Ethereum Request for Comment 20'. The Binance Smart Chain uses a similar standard, which is the BEP-20 standard.\n\nThese standards contains numerous functions that allow any token that has implemented this set of functions to be traded. Examples of those functions are:\n\n* Sending tokens.\n* Request balance information from any address.\n* List the number of available tokens.\n\n# Layer 2 solutions\n\nBecause of high demand, the Ethereum network is getting overloaded. This resulted in very high transaction fees, making it to expensive for small investors to use it's dapps.\n\nThis is the main reason why many investors moved to the Binance Smart Chain, which has much lower fees, untill Ethereum 2.0 has been implemented, which is an update that will drastically lower the transaction fees for the network.\n\nHowever, in order for the Binance Smart Chain to maintain such low transaction fees, it had to sacrifice it's decentralized properties. This resulted in that the Binance Smart Chain is much more centralized and less safe compared to Ethereum.\n\nFortunately, there are various projects working on Layer 2 solutions to improve both the scalability and speed of the Ethereum network. Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework, chain or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system. By doing so, the mainchain can be unloaded and can solely focus on the safety of the network.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, there are currently 2 sidechains that are pegged to it. These chains are the xDai chain and the Polygon chain. The latter of the sidechains is the most promising Layer 2 solution so far.\n\nBy bridging your assets from the Ethereum mainchain to the sidechains, you are able to interact with various dapps that work on these sidechains for almost an negligible amount transaction fees.\n\n# Getting started\n\nNow that you're aware of the fundamentals of DeFi, let's dive into how you can move your assets into the various DeFi protocols.\n\n# Setting up your wallet\n\nIn order to move your assets from your wallet on the exchange that you're using to either the Ethereum network, Binance Smart Chain, or Sidechains, you will need a browser wallet that can interact with these DeFi protocols.\n\nI'm currently using MetaMask, so I will use this browser wallet in this guide:\n\n1. Go to the official MetaMask website in your browser ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/))\n2. Press \u201cGet Chrome extension\u201d, \u201cChrome Firefox Opera\u201d or \u201cGet Brave Browser\u201d. This of course depends on the browser you want to use at that time.\n3. You will now be taken to a page where you can add the extension. With Chrome, for example, there is a button with: + ADD. TO CHROME. Click on the button.\n4. A popup appears to confirm this\n5. You will now see a MetaMask logo at the top right of the browser. Click this to set up MetaMask.\n6. Accept the terms and conditions\n7. Create and confirm a new password. Please remember this password.\n8. You will now see 12 words. With these words you can always recover your wallet - in combination with the password. Write these words down and keep them safe. Preferably offline - just on paper.\n9. Congratulations! You have now installed and configured a MetaMask extension. You can now use the buttons \u201cBuy\u201d and \u201cSend\u201d to buy or send Ether to your wallet. You can now also send Ethereum to the address under \u201cAccount 1\u201d.\n\nYour MetaMask wallet will be automatically connected to the Ethereum network. In order to connect your MetaMask to the Binance Smart Chain, Polygon or xDai, follow these steps:\n\n1. Click on the network in the top right corner.\n2. Go to settings.\n3. Click \"Add network\"\n\nIn order to setup your wallet for the Binance Smart Chain, enter the following parameters:\n\nNetwork Name: Smart Chain\n\nNew RPC URL: [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)\n\nChainID: 56\n\nSymbol: BNB\n\nBlock Explorer URL: [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order to setup your wallet for the Polygon sidechain, enter the following parameters:\n\nNetwork Name: Matic Mainnet\n\nNew RPC URL: [https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)\n\nChainID: 137\n\nSymbol: MATIC\n\nBlock Explorer URL: [https://explorer.matic.network/](https://explorer.matic.network/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order to setup your wallet for the xDai sidechain, enter the following parameters:\n\nNetwork Name: xDai\n\nNew RPC URL: [https://rpc.xdaichain.com/](https://rpc.xdaichain.com/)\n\nChain ID: 0x64\n\nSymbol: xDai\n\nBlock Explorer URL: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet)\n\n# Faucets\n\nIn order to be able to perform transactions on these chains, you need to have some of their coins/tokens in your wallet in order to pay for the transaction fees.\n\n* In order to use Ethereum you need Ether\n* In order to use Binance Smart Chain you need BNB\n* In order to use xDai you need xDai\n* In order to use Polygon you need Matic\n\nLuckily you can get small amounts of the currencies for free from so called faucets.\n\nA faucet is an app or a website that distributes small amounts of cryptocurrencies. They\u2019re given the name \u201cfaucets'' because the rewards are small, just like small drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet.\n\nHowever, in the case of crypto faucets, tiny amounts of free or earned cryptocurrency are sent to a user\u2019s wallet. In order to get free crypto, users need to complete tasks as simple as viewing ads, watching product videos, completing quizzes, clicking links (be careful!) or completing a captcha.\n\nYou can use the following faucets to receive small amounts of crypto:\n\n* xDai: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet)\n* Matic: [https://matic.supply](https://matic.supply)\n\nUnfortunately. I wasn't able to find any faucets for Ether or BNB.\n\n# Sending crypto from the exchange to MetaMask\n\nIn order to receive send your assets to MetaMask wallet, you need to fill in the correct address. This is probably straight forward for most of you, but please make sure to quadruple check you're MetaMask wallet address before sending your tokens from the exchange to your address.\n\nWhen you're sending tokens from Binance, it will ask if you want to send them as BEP20 or ERC20 tokens. Please choose the correct one! Sending BEP20 tokens to your Ethereum address can result in a loss or they end up in your Binance Smart Chain wallet.\n\n# Bridging: An important step!\n\nPlease notice that you can't send your tokens directly from the exchange to sidechains such as xDai or Polygon! You need to send them first to the Ethereum network (as they are both sidechains pegged to the Ethereum blockchain). Once received, you can bridge them to xDai or Polygon by using the following links:\n\n* [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/)\n* [https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)\n\nKeep in mind that for during the bridging, Ethereum transactions fees have to be paid. After the bridging, you play by the rules of the sidechain (which means cheap transactions).\n\n# I can't find my tokens in my wallet!\n\nIf you can't find your tokens back in your wallet after sending them from the exchange, you can follow these steps:\n\n* Check the transaction record, is the transaction completed?\n* Make sure you look at the right network. Your MetaMask wallet might be connected to the Binance Smart Chain network, hence not showing your assets.\n* Add the contract address of your token to the wallet. You can find the address of your token via [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) (Ethereum) or [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/yieldfarms) (Binance Smart Chain). The token address can then be copied in to the MetaMask wallet by clicking on add custom token.\n\n# Setting up your dashboard\n\nTo make things a bit more clear, I would advice you to use the DeFi dashboard [Zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi/). Zapper is an interesting platform that lets you quickly and easily deploy and manage your DeFi positions within a single interface. It is a DeFi portfolio management dashboard that helps you stay on top of your portfolio, liquidity pools, and liquidity mining positions.\n\nZapper supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, xDai and Polygon. In order to connect to the right network, you must first connect your MetaMask to the network you want zapper to connect to. By clicking in the top right corner of your MetaMask wallet you can connect to the network you want Zapper to manage for you.\n\nThe first tab of Zapper, shows an overview of your account. It shows the value of your assets in your MetaMask wallet and how your deployed assets are performing in the DeFi protocols (if you deployed any already).\n\nIn order to reduce gas fees, Zapper has several features that can \"Zap\" your assets fast and \"cheap\" in order to:\n\n* Start providing liquidity in a pool.\n* Swap tokens.\n* Bridge your tokens from one network to another.\n\nZapper also keeps track of the estimated APY's (Annual Percentage Yield) of the various pools from different DeFi protocols as well as farming opportunities.\n\n# A list of DeFi protocols\n\nBefore wrapping this post up, I want to share the following website: [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/)\n\nDeFi Pulse records the top performing DeFi protocols on the Ethereum main chain as well as their TVL (total locked value) and ranks them accordingly. This page is really worth checking out as it can help you to pick the right protocols to deploy your assets in.\n\nIn order to monitor the DeFi space of Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and xDai I like to use [https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi](https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi) and [https://defiprime.com/#defi\\_projects](https://defiprime.com/#defi_projects). However, If you use other resources in order to find the right dapp, let me know!\n\n# That's it for this guide!\n\nI really do hope that this guide helps you to get started on your DeFi adventure.If I missed something or whatever let me know so I can change it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If you found this guide helpful, [please read my DeFi (Decentralized Finance) series](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mdjsrj/defi_explained_defi_wallets/). I've covered a wide plethora of subjects and linked all posts to make it more convenient for you to read.\n* Interested in Layer 2 solutions? [Read my post about ZK Rollup](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nctot7/defi_explained_zk_rollups/)s!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: All right, there\u2019s some confusion here whether Binance Smart Chain is decentralized or not. It\u2019s NOT decentralized. The Binance Smart Chain is a fork of the Ethereum blockchain that sacrificed it\u2019s safety and decentralized aspect in order to maintain low transaction fees and higher scalability!\n\nEDIT 2: As pointed out by some comments, this post doesn't explain WHY you want to use DeFi. Unknown to many, this guide is part of a long series of posts, called \"DeFi Explained\". If you're interested in why you should-/want to- use DeFi, the following posts will be useful for you:\n\n* [Liquidity Pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mfk2oi/defi_explained_liquidity_pools/)\n* [Lending and Borrowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mnzv1c/defi_explained_lending_borrowing/)\n* [Yield Farming](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n0yng2/defi_explained_yield_farming/)\n* [Indices](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/muonht/defi_explained_indices/)\n* [Derivatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt8c67/defi_explained_derivatives/)\n* [Margin Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mslzt8/defi_explained_margin_trading/)\n* [Wrapped Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mh2oc7/defi_explained_wrapped_bitcoin/)\n* [Stablecoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mysxvz/defi_explained_stablecoins/)\n\nFollow me on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/MosDefi](https://twitter.com/MosDefi)  \nOr follow me on Medium: [https://mosdefi.medium.com/](https://mosdefi.medium.com/) ",

A few months ago it seemed like everyone influential in crypto was predicting $100k BTC by the end of the year. However, it doesn't look like that's going to happen with the state of the market at the moment. It would take something absolutely miraculous to essentially double BTC's market cap by the end of the year. This confirms three things to me:\n\n1.) It seems like many crypto investors, especially the influential onces are still way too optimistic and everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\n2.) The \"so called\" experts that keep being asked for predictions have no idea what they're talking about, just pulling random predictions out of their behind.\n\n3.) Technical analysis in crypto can only tell you so much. Essentially, everybody (including the \"experts\") knows shit about fuck, and you're much better doing your own research than investing based on what these bozos say. \n\n**TLDR:** DYOR",

    "postText": "The most important piece of regulation on cryptocurrencies in the world thus far has arrived: I read through all 405 pages of the \u201cProposal for EU Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets\u201d so you don\u2019t have to. Here are my conclusions. # I present to you, the most important regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies so far: \"Proposal for a Regulation Of The European Parliament and of The Council on Markets in Crypto-assets, and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937\".\n\n(TL;DR BELOW)\n\n**First of all, some context. This will be a long post but sometimes long posts are necessary. Bear with me.** \n\nThe proposed Regulation, the most important one to date for the entire crypto industry, establishes rules for issuers/offerors of crypto-assets (also known as: the foundations, developers and companies behind coins/tokens) and crypto-asset service providers (also known as: exchanges and custodians).\n\nThese rules will have to be followed by every entity operating in the European Union. However, because of the \u201c*Brussels Effect*\u201d, there is a very good chance these rules will become international standards in the end. While everyone is focused on the US and China, the EU is casually leading the way.\n\nThe Council of the European Union (all EU Ministers of Finance or Economics) has just given its permission to start negotiations with the European Parliament (basically: things just got real). If they both approve the proposed Regulation, it will become EU law. I expect the Regulation to be voted through relatively easily with only minor amendments. The final legal text to become official EU law will thus be *very similar* to the current proposal I will be discussing in this post.\n\nThe European Union emphasizes that they have an interest in \u201cdeveloping and promoting the uptake of transformative technologies in the financial sector, including distributed ledger technology (DLT)\u201d. They state that this Regulation is meant to: \u201csupport innovation and fair competition, while ensuring a high level of protection of retail holders and market integrity in crypto-asset markets, enable crypto-asset service providers to scale up their business on a cross-border basis, and facilitate their access to banking services to run their activities smoothly\". The EU also says that they do not (!) intend to regulate the underlying technology of crypto-assets.\n\nI will now discuss (1) the rules this Regulation sets out for issuers/offerors of different categories of crypto-assets and (2) the rules set out for exchanges operating in the European Union.\n\n*Rules in this Regulation for Issuers/Offerors of Crypto-Assets*\n\n**A) Crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets: no regulations**\n\nNFTs, including digital art and collectibles are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation, even when these assets are traded in market places and when they have (high) speculative value.\n\n**B)** **Utility Tokens: no regulations**\n\n\u2018Utility token\u2019 means a type of crypto-asset which is only intended to provide access to a good or a service supplied by the issuer of that token (EU definition). Utility tokens are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation, as long as the good or service exists or is in operation.\n\n**C)** **Crypto-assets offered for free: no regulations**\n\nCrypto-assets where the receiver does not give money, fees, personal data or commissions to the offerors/issuers in return for those crypto-assets, are not (!) bound to bound to the rules described in this Regulation. This may be good news for Moons (there is no active exchange of personal data in return for Moons; even when Reddit collects personal data from all users).\n\n**D) Crypto-assets that are \u201cautomatically created as a reward for the maintenance of the DLT or the validation of transactions in the context of a consensus mechanism\u201d: no regulations**\n\nThese crypto-assets are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation.\n\n**E) E-Money (stablecoins): very strict regulations**\n\n\u2018Electronic money token\u2019 or \u2018e-money token\u2019 means a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to the value of an official currency of a country (EU definition). These tokens will be strictly regulated. Only recognized credit institutions and \u2018electronic money institutions\u2019 are allowed to issue e-money stablecoins. They will have to follow very strict rules (see Regulation Title IV for further details). Edit 1: As part of these strict rules, it seems that EU citizens would also not be able to earn interest on stablecoins, as pointed out by u/TheWerewolf5. Edit 2: it will take a while before this is all signed into law so exchanges still have a few years to phase out Tether for regulated stablecoins. There won't be a sudden Tether apocalypse. \n\n**F) Asset-Referenced Tokens (stablecoins): very strict regulations**\n\n\u2018Asset-referenced token\u2019 means a type of crypto-asset that is not an electronic money token and that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to any other value or right or a combination thereof, including one or several official currencies of a country (EU definition). This is what Facebook/Meta tried to do with Libra. These tokens will be strictly regulated. Only recognized credit institutions and entities that have been granted permission by the authority of an EU Member State can issue asset-referenced stablecoins in the European Union. They will have to follow very strict rules (see Regulation Title III for further details).\n\n**G)** **Crypto-assets that do not belong to any of the previously mentioned categories (e.g. payment coins that do not promise a stable value or tokens that cannot be seen as utility tokens): some regulations**\n\nThese crypto-assets face some regulation. The Regulation describes very detailed rules on the contents of white papers and also establishes rules on marketing communications. This is bad news for scams with poorly written, undetailed white papers and those using misleading forms of marketing. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will most likely establish templates and standards for white papers in the crypto-industry (see Regulation Title II for further details).\n\n*Rules in this Regulation for Exchanges and Custodians*\n\n**A) Exchanges / custodians (centralized): rather strict regulations**\n\nThe Regulation focuses on establishing strict rules, such as: the obligation to apply for official authorization in an EU Member States; the obligation to act in the best interest of clients; the obligation for capital requirements, safeguards and insurance policies; the obligation to follow organizational requirements; the obligation to protect the crypto-assets and funds of clients; the obligation to hold the crypto-assets of clients in separate accounts than the accounts belonging to the exchange; the obligation to maintain effective and transparent complaint handling procedures; the obligation to identify, disclose and prevent conflicts of interest; the obligation to have resilient trading systems with sufficient capacity to deal with peak order and message volumes; and much more (see Regulation Title V for further details).\n\nThere is, however, a small but concerning statement for privacy coins: \u201cThe operating rules of the trading platform for crypto-assets shall prevent the admission to trading of crypto-assets which have inbuilt anonymisation function unless the holders of the crypto-assets and their transaction history can be identified by the crypto-asset service providers that are authorised for the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets\u201d. What exactly they mean with this and which coins exactly fall under this category still remains to be seen. But I don't think this comes as a shock for many.\n\n**B) Fully decentralized exchanges and DeFi: no regulations (yet)**\n\nFully decentralized exchanges and DeFi protocols are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation. Exchanges that are only partially decentralized may be bound to some of the rules in this Regulation but this is up for interpretation. The EU will, in the next few years, explore whether or not they will regulate this specific space.\n\n**C)** **Self-custody software wallets / hardware wallets: no regulations**\n\nThese are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation. Remember the huge \"EU will ban anonymous wallets\" FUD a few months ago? It was all a lie. No rules!\n\n*Overall assessment*\n\nI am pleasantly surprised. While some of you want nothing to do with regulation, which I respect, this seems very reasonable and a step in the right direction. This text has clearly been written by highly knowledge civil servants and has been endorsed by EU Ministers of Finance with a more open approach to blockchain and cryptocurrencies than their non-EU counterparts. The EU made the mistake of allowing the US/Asia to dominate the tech industry. They do not want to repeat that mistake with the cryptocurrency space.\n\n**TL;DR: Cryptocurrency will still be the 'Wild West of Finance'; but now there will be a new Sheriff in town. And that Sheriff, is the European Union. It does no longer tolerate unregulated stablecoins; it does no longer tolerate shady projects with no utility, crappy white papers, and misleading marketing; and it sure as hell does no longer tolerate unprofessional exchanges who screw EU citizens out of their money. But it does like innovation and it will try** ***not*** **to hinder development in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space because they have made similar mistakes before in other industries.**\n\nLink to follow-up on the Ordinary Legislative Procedure: [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/HIS/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/HIS/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593)\n\nLink to the proposed EU Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets: [https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/53105/st14067-en21.pdf](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/53105/st14067-en21.pdf)\n\nLink to the \"Brussels Effect\": [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels\\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect)\n\nBlogs, crypto journalists (you know who you are), etc. are all free to use the info in this post. **No need to credit me**.

First post here! I'm a new comer to the world of crypto. As I was doing my research on alt coins I found market cap to be essential in understanding the relative size and the potential upside of different coins. I found myself constantly doing mental math using CoinMarketCap data, so I decided to build myself a little private website to help with all that! Example: \"_if coin X had market cap of coin Y, it would be worth $Z_\". I figured others are probably in the same position, so I published it yesterday for the world to use. :)\n\nI proudly present to you **[thecoinperspective.com](https://thecoinperspective.com/)**!\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Supports the top 500 non-stable coins/tokens as per CoinMarketCap data.

    "postText": "A Coinbase Product Manager was Just Charged With Insider Trading and Arrested While Trying to Flee the Country From the Justice Department:\n\nBeginning in approximately October 2020, ISHAN WAHI worked at Coinbase as a product manager assigned to a Coinbase asset listing team. In that role, ISHAN WAHI was involved in the highly confidential process of listing crypto assets on Coinbase\u2019s exchanges and had detailed and advanced knowledge of which crypto assets Coinbase was planning to list and the timing of public announcements about those crypto asset listings.  Beginning at least in August 2021 and continuing through May 2022, ISHAN WAHI was a member of a private Coinbase messaging channel reserved for a small number of Coinbase employees with direct involvement in the Coinbase asset listing process.  The private channel was used to discuss, among other things, \u201cexact announcement / launch dates + timelines\u201d that Coinbase did not wish to share with all of its employees.\n\n***The Insider Trading Scheme:***\n\nOn at least 14 occasions beginning at least in June 2021 and continuing through April 2022, ISHAN WAHI knew in advance both that Coinbase planned to list particular crypto assets and the timing of Coinbase\u2019s public announcements of those asset listings and misappropriated that Coinbase confidential information by tipping either his brother, NIKHIL WAHI, or ISHAN WAHI\u2019s friend and associate, SAMEER RAMANI, so that they could place profitable trades in those crypto assets in advance of Coinbase\u2019s public listing announcements.\n\nAfter getting tips from ISHAN WAHI, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI used anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to acquire crypto assets shortly before Coinbase publicly announced that it was listing or considering listing these crypto assets on its exchanges.  Following Coinbase public listing announcements, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI sold the crypto assets for a profit.  Based on confidential information provided by ISHAN WAHI, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI collectively traded shortly in advance of at least 14 separate Coinbase public listing announcements concerning at least 25 different crypto assets.  As a result of the insider trading scheme, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI collectively generated realized and unrealized gains totaling at least approximately $1.5 million.\n\nTo conceal their purchases of crypto assets in advance of Coinbase listing announcements, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI used accounts at centralized exchanges held in the names of others, and transferred funds, crypto assets, and proceeds of their scheme through multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets.  NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI also regularly created and used new Ethereum blockchain wallets without any prior transaction history in order to further conceal their involvement in the scheme.\n\n***ISHAN WAHI\u2019s Attempt to Flee the United States:***\n\nOn April 11, 2022, Coinbase announced that it was considering potentially listing dozens of crypto assets on its exchanges. Based on Coinbase confidential information provided by ISHAN WAHI, RAMANI caused multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to purchase large quantities of at least six of the crypto assets that were to be included in Coinbase\u2019s April 11, 2022 listing announcement.\n\nShortly after RAMANI traded in advance of Coinbase\u2019s April 11 listing announcement, on April 12, 2022, a Twitter account that is well known in the crypto community tweeted regarding an Ethereum blockchain wallet \u201cthat bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens exclusively featured in the Coinbase Asset Listing post about 24 hours before it was published.\u201d  The trading activity referenced in the April 12 tweet was the trading caused by RAMANI.  Coinbase thereafter publicly replied on Twitter noting that it had already begun investigating the matter and a few weeks later stated in a public blog post that any Coinbase employee who leaked confidential company information would be \u201cimmediately terminated and referred to relevant authorities (potentially for criminal prosecution).\u201d\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Coinbase\u2019s director of security operations emailed ISHAN WAHI to inform him that he should appear for an in-person meeting relating to Coinbase\u2019s asset listing process at Coinbase\u2019s Seattle, Washington office on Monday, May 16, 2022. ISHAN WAHI confirmed he would attend the meeting.\n\nOn the evening of Sunday, May 15, 2022, ISHAN WAHI purchased a one-way flight to India that was scheduled to depart the next day shortly before ISHAN WAHI was supposed to be interviewed by Coinbase.  Prior to boarding the flight, ISHAN WAHI falsely told Coinbase employees that he had already departed for India when he had not.  In the hours between booking the flight and his scheduled departure, ISHAN WAHI called and texted NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI about Coinbase\u2019s investigation, and sent both of them a photograph of the messages he had received on May 11, 2022, from Coinbase\u2019s director of security operations.  Prior to boarding the May 16, 2022 flight to India, ISHAN WAHI was stopped by law enforcement and prevented from leaving the country.\n\nYou can read the entire transcript here:\n\n[https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/three-charged-first-ever-cryptocurrency-insider-trading-tipping-scheme](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/three-charged-first-ever-cryptocurrency-insider-trading-tipping-scheme)",

I remember at the time thinking there was about a 1/3 chance it would 100x, so there was an asymmetrical risk/reward in my opinion. \n\nSold a large chunk during the previous bull run in 2017, and sold the remaining in multiple sales this January. Averaged about a 150x on my cost basis across all sales. All long-term capital gains. Now I'm 27 and financially independent. Will be buying my parents a house this year.\n\nI love this community and hope both the technology and price continues to improve. Thanks to everyone for making this a fun ride!",

Your desk or table or something like that.\n\nBe right here for a minute. Just focus on your breathing.\n\nI know things are a lot right now and this dip is scary, but also right now you're ok. Walk away from the charts for a while, enjoy your friends/family/pets and come back after a while. This shit happens all the time in crypto and we are still solidly in the midst of a bullrun. Give the whales time to shake out weak hands in order to scoop up more on discount. If you can buy the dip, if you can't buy the dip just hold and you'll be ok if you just have patience.\n\nIf you're panicking right now, maybe reconsider how much you have invested or what coins your invested in. This is a volitile space and your mental health is more important than some quick gains. Take care of yourself, stay hydrated, check your posture, and keep a big picture perspective.",

    "postText": "How a became a millionaire using crypto technical analysis and here is a guide I wanna share how i became a millionaire using technical analysis and maybe you can do it to.\n\nTechnical analysis is the study of statistical trends, collected from historical price and volume data, to identify opportunities for trade. Technical analysts observe patterns of price movements, trading signal and other analytical tools to evaluate the strength and weakness of an asset. \u00a0\n\nTechnical Analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data such as cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities and stocks.\n\nA chart of prices and volume represents all the past decisions taken by market participants (buying and selling). This information will, in turn, affect future participant decisions in two ways:\n\n* **Psychological**: What you did in the past affects how you approach future situations. For example, many traders tend to focus on the price at which they bought an asset, and if it declines, they want to sell when it reaches break-even again.\n* **Reflexive**: Some traders identify trends and chart patterns which are common, and act accordingly (buying or selling). If a sufficient number of participants follow the same strategy, it is expected that these chart patterns will follow the expected outcome and that the trend will likely to be sustained by more and more participants joining the trend.\n\n**Bollinger Bands**\n\nBollinger Bands display a graphical band (the envelope) with a simple moving average in the middle. The width of the envelope expresses the volatility.\n\nVolatility refers to the rate at which the price of an asset can increase or decrease. A higher volatility means that the asset can potentially **fluctuate rapidly within a larger range of value**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqjqtkv7vtg61.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1d0ccd3978189d96ff1c49991c8fd7d602eb716\n\n**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence (or MACD) is a trend following indicator that looks at the combination of two moving averages:\n\n* A short-term moving average\n* A long-term moving average  \n\n\nThese two moving averages are combined to identify what is the current trend and if there is a change in the momentum.  \n\n\nThe MACD lines displayed below can be interpreted as follows:  \n\n\n* If the blue line (MACD line) is above the orange line (Signal line), the momentum is bullish.\n* On the contrary, if the blue line is below the orange line, the momentum is bearish.\n* When the lines diverge, it denotes a strengthening of the current trend while a convergence shows a trend reversal.\n* When the lines cross, it is likely that the change in momentum is confirmed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1iv2s4bvtg61.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4f063008c7a3775a6021b6047c3c7b179abc7db\n\n**So what did i do?** \n\n**I started with the basic, BUY HIGH, SELL LOW. I used $2.500.000,- from my wife, put in crypto. Lost 50%. deposit the rest into my account. $1.250.000,- profit.... Simple like that.** \n\n**Your welcome**\n\nSource:  [https://swissborg.com/blog/how-to-apply-technical-analysis-to-cryptocurrencies](https://swissborg.com/blog/how-to-apply-technical-analysis-to-cryptocurrencies)",

    "postText": "I'm Truly Disappointed. Guys. We need to talk:\n\nThis subreddit above all else is supposed to be a hub of news, useful discourse, information, and understanding of cryptocurrencies/crypto assets in general. Through it I've found some amazing coins and made investments that I would have never known to make.\n\nBut that's only because I didn't listen to the trash level sentiment being carried out and the hardcore tribalism that causes people to lose out on good, solid investments. So here, lemme break this into 3 categories:\n\n**FOR THE INVESTORS**\n\nIt has become incredibly clear to me that FAR too large of a portion of our reader base on this sub is entirely unaware of the fundamentals of investing in new tech. This is not a sports team, this is not some TV show or fad, THIS IS A BRAND FUCKING NEW ASSET CLASS THAT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE OUR SOCIETY. And it is MUCH too early to be acting like we've already made our correct bets and that nothing can happen to change the trajectory of our favorite project.\n\n1) How is the TECH/Whitepaper? (this should always be your FIRST question)\n\n2) How is the Dev Team?\n\n3) Do they have a funding scheme? What kind? (community donation, venture capital, institutional investment/buyouts, ICO etc.)\n\n4) How are they organized?\n\n5) How is their track record?\n\n6) Do they have any institutional or prolific backing?\n\n7) Does it solve a goddamn problem or alleviate friction anywhere?\n\n8) Does it have competition and where does it stand within that?\n\n9) How close to ready is it?\n\n10) Any plans to create, stimulate, and maintain adoption?\n\n11) Does it have a Marketing and media presence? A good one?\n\n12) How is its Mainstream visibility?\n\n13) How about Accesibility and Liquidity?\n\n14) Growth potential based on current price and supply\n\n15) Can it survive or at least get around the regulatory hammer?\n\nRegardless of what you think your coin's shit smells like, these are the things you need to know in order to decide where the hell you're putting your money. Because each and every single one of these questions is important in determining the value potential and sustainability of your coin. If you actually care about making money then you'll shed your need to be on a single team and diversify your assets based on the fundamentals. Yes, I know a month feels like an entire year in crypto, but investment is NORMALLY supposed to be a multi-decade affair. Meanwhile longterm for most of us means 2022 at the latest. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.\n\n**FOR THE DAY TRADERS**\n\nIn general, you have a very simple job. Look at graphs, do some TA, make a plan, invest based on that and do your best to have orders and trading set up that minimizes risk. So just do that. I don't want to hear a single one of you coming through a subreddit and moaning about how you think something is a shitcoin because it wasn't volatile enough that day to make you dumb amounts of money. No one is saying you aren't making hella money or that you aren't right from a daytrading perspective, but keep that to the trading subreddits where other like-minded people are actually impatient enough to care about that. You should understand that when you put up some pissy comment like that, new investors who haven't the faintest clue on anything will take what you say seriously and model their money movement around your words.\n\nThink about that.\n\nIf I had listened to day traders, as a mid-long term investor, I'd have missed out on NEO (back when it was Antshares), ICX, and XRP. I would have missed out on the following percentage gains:\n\nNEO: 1150% Gains as of now\nICX: 5080% Gains as of now\nXRP: 1720% Gains as of now\n\n^Why would I want to miss out on that because of impatience and bad philosophy?\n\n**FOR THE SUPPORTERS**\n\nFor people who are genuinely in this for philosophy, that's great, discuss the merits of your philosophy and vision and why you think the coin aligns with that. Otherwise:\n\nSHUT THE FUCK UP.\n\nIf you don't, you'll start spreading FUD and lies, it's inevitable, the second you decide to trash another coin you're going to do it as a way to feel superior regardless of how good or shitty your investment is.\n\nI'm done.",

Through trial and error we all found out small (or big) \u201clifehacks\u201d that newbies should know from the very start.\n\nPlease feel free to share your most useful lifehacks that you found while walking the streets of DeFi.\n\nMy top 3 lifehacks are next:\n\n1.  when moving funds across exchanges be smart and use XLM or ALGO for super cheap and super fast transactions. \n\n2. use bookmarks to avoid getting on a phishing site by accident. Google doesn\u2019t do much about preventing phishing sites to appear in search results, so bookmark them for your safety\n\n3. use whitelisting addresses on exchanges to strengthen your security. Its easy to set it up and effective so that your funds cant go anywhere but to your wallets",

    "postText": "YSK: The 'i got hacked' post are probably scammers themselves hoping for donations and you should not send them any money.  It seems everyday, there is a new post where someone's metamask gets hacked for 6 figures of ETH. They post the victim and scammer addresses and go on about reaching out to law enforcement blah blah. If you have ever seen a real scammers account, there are usually tons of transactions and money being moved quick to avoid being black listed by exchanges.  The past few post ive seen, the 'hackers' account has only 1 transaction. Seems strange doesn't it?   \nLet's also take OP's Reddit age into account .   \n  \nNow, not all post are scams but unfortunately, it only takes a few bad apples to spoil the bunch.  With it being the holidays, people probably feel a bit more generous and want to help out someone in need.",

I just looked at the price and its still at $48,000. That thing hasn't moved in over 6 months. Has Satoshi stopped the Bitcoin servers? WTF is going on? I guess I will go back to the stock market where we get real volatility. I once made +2.4% in the stock market in just 5 months, we sometimes get -5% drops but I guess the stock market isn't for the light hearted. Oh well what would you kids know about volatility",

Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.\n* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month\n* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?\n* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).\n\n***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***\n\n1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)\n2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. \n3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).\n4. Giveaways: Who doesn\u2019t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I\u2019ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I\u2019m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.\n5.

After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.\n\nAfter reaching an All Time High (+72%) in\u00a0[October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.\u00a0 After four years of holding these

2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThere was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year\u2019s Day 2018, you\u2019d be doing much, much better than the Experiment\u2019s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the

four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.\u00a0 And all ten of the green months have come in 2021.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6\n\nThe all time high for this portfolio is\u00a0[October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46)\u00a0(+72%).\u00a0 The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down\u00a0[\\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRemember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.\u00a0 The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.\n\n## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios\n\nAlright, that\u2019s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t stop the Experiment in 2018:\u00a0 I invested another $1000 in

    "postText": "The Bitgrail hack was months ago, bomber defrauded new users of their assets to pay off old users. This is a criminal act. We need to contact the EU/Italian authorities & make sure he's punished. Let's be clear here Francesco Firano (/u/TheBomber9) is a criminal. The hack was in November which means that he's been insolvent for months & has been defrauding new users out of their money to keep the exchange afloat. Once the Binance listing was imminent he locked all the exchange's assets. His actions show clear intent. If his exchange was hacked & he immediately reported it to the police, he'd just be incompetent but by hiding this from new users he transitioned from moron to criminal. \n\nThis is the US legal definition of Fraud:\n\n* Fraud. A false representation of a matter of fact\u2014whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, **or by concealment of what should have been disclosed**\u2014that deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.\n\n[In order to be convicted of fraud in the US, the following must be proved:](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud)\n\n>Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: \n\n> * (1) a false statement of a material fact,\n\n>* (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, \n\n>* (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, \n\n>* (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and \n\n>* (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.\n\nNow I'm not a lawyer but it seems to me that he is clearly guilty & convictable. It's likely the EU/Italian definition is the same since fraud is a universal crime. [He may also be guilty of running a ponzi scheme](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ponzi_scheme)\n\nWe need to make sure people don't get away with this sort of thing. I don't want to say he's destroyed people's lives because there is almost always a way to recover but he has certainly severely damaged peoples wellbeing. \n\nI'm in the US but if someone in the EU/Italy could contact the authorities & let them know about the situation maybe we can get a little bit of justice for his victims. I don't trust him at all when he said he has reported this to authorities, it's **very likely he completely misrepresented the situation to them** even if he did (which is also a crime).\n\nIf you live in the USA & are a victim please call the FBI to file a report. Apparently extradition is possible between the USA & Italy. If there is enough outcry about this situation maybe we can get the wheels turning.\n\nEdit: [He's also guilty of embezzlement](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embezzlement )\n\n> Elements common to embezzlement are as follows: (1) the property must belong to a person other than the accused, such as an employer or principal; (2) the property must be converted subsequent to the defendant's original and lawful possession of it; (3) the defendant must be in a position of trust, so that the property is held by him or her pursuant to some fiduciary duty; and (4) the defendant must have an intent to defraud the owner at the time of the conversion.\n\nEdit: Evidence he knew about the hack (personally I think it's borderline impossible for him not to realize he's missing over 3/4ths of the XRB in his wallet but here's some hard evidence anyways).\nFrom https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/7wm2sp/collect_bitgrail_evidence_here/\nScreenshots of negative balance issues from January: https://imgur.com/a/FCIme https://imgur.com/a/YYf0U https://imgur.com/a/Qg7BL",

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.\n\nSo, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!\n\nHere's hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too.\n\nEdit: spelling",

That is just impossible, unless somehow they have developed ways to crack SHA256 and brute force wallet private keys. In which case, BTC is the least of everyone's worries and state/nuclear secrets could be under risk. \n\n[While Bitcoin isn\u2019t stored on a server, the private keys to unlock the Bitcoin may have been.

This is some of the weakest FUD but people still seem to be falling for this.\n\n\nEdit: Lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed \"quantum computers\" that can crack/hack bitcoin private keys. While quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future, they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address. \n\nAs per u/BreakingBaIIs : \n\n> I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.\n\n> If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.\n\nThe complexity of cracking a single BTC private key is large and currently not in existence. \n\nMoreover, if such a powerful computer existed, it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto. The entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption. Nothing would be safe. In fact, someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into Federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there, or hack into Bank of England and shut everything down. In other words, cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats, because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over. \n\nIf they had quantum computers, they wont be asking Apple to de-encrypt devices seized from criminals. \n\nIf they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any BTC address, they wont bother recovering measly 60 BTC from the 80 BTC ransom, when they can just send BTC to zero by hacking and moving Satoshi coins, thus destroying BTC's narrative completely. \n\nTl:dr - Its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists. While it is true that research and development on quantum computers is an ongoing topic, there is no evidence to suggest that such a quantum computing system exists today that can derive BTC private keys from just the addresses.",

    "postText": "Real, mainstream crypto adoption is happening right now. You just haven't realized. Yes, that's quite the title, I know. But after seeing the hundredth post on the frontpage talking about altcoins that have real use cases, I can't stop thinking about this one.\n\nYou all know Venezuela, right? The country with space-high inflation rates, the one that /r/cryptocurrency says crypto adoption is feasible. \n\nWell, it's finally really happening.\n\nI'm Venezuelan, so let me explain some weird things about our economy. First, prices double every 3 months. Second, we don't have access to USD bank accounts in the country. And third, physical cash is scarce: Bolivares because you need a lot of them to pay for little, and USD because the \"dollarization\" isn't official, small change simply doesn't exist (coins, for example). This creates the perfect variables for digital, exact payment. This is where the Reserve Protocol comes in.\n\nWe have been using some digital payments app since a while ago, apps like Zelle, PayPal or Transferwise. The problem with those apps is that they often close accounts in Venezuela to avoid problems with the US government. Simply put, those companies just didn't want to deal with the problem that is Venezuela related legislation.\n\nEnter [Reserve.](https://reserve.org/) The team at Reserve created a stablecoin alongside an easy to use app for mainstream use. The app allows people to deposit Bolivares (the local currency) from their bank account and instantly exchange them for dollars (RSV stablecoins!). You might be thinking, well, that isn't that big of a deal, is it? Thing is, it is. Venezuelans can't just exchange Bol\u00edvares to USD legally because there aren't any bank accounts in USD inside Venezuela. The only way to save in USD would be to open an account in Panam\u00e1 or risk your money getting lost in Zelle or PayPal. The app allows people to send RSV, pay with RSV, receive any crypto and convert it to RSV or Bolivares and so on. Reserve is literally saving people from hyperinflation.\n\nWell, why do I say mainstream crypto adoption is happening? Because people aren't paying in bolivares anymore. It is estimated that in 2020, 55% of transactions were made in foreign currency, and that number just keeps growing everyday. Now, the great part.\n\n**The Reserve app has more than 100k downloads.** **People are using** **crypto, not as a way to invest, not as a store of value, but as it was intended: a currency.**  And it's happening right in front of us, but we're too worried about the price going up or down so much that we missed the real reason crypto is here: to serve as a currency when fiat fails us. In my case, fiat failed me. And crypto, for me and many more, is the way.",

We all know that memecoins like DOGE have pumped and made many people rich. That's why people invest in memecoins, because it's a potential goldmine if you get in early with the right one. However, once a memecoin pumps, how will they attract new investors if they think the main pump has already happened? \n\nThis has already happened with SHIB. Why did so many people invest in SHIB? Because they saw what happened with DOGE and bought into what they believed was \"the next DOGE\", a new memecoin with a growing community that they thought could \"do what DOGE did\". And they were right! The early investors have made a lot of money with SHIB. However, after the BIG pump is over, do new investors want the coin that has already had the big pumps, or the newest memecoin that has the potential to do what that memecoin did? \n\nMemes die, and so do memecoins. How often do you see Ugandan Knuckles memes anymore? The kind of people who invest in memecoins are  trying to find \"the next DOGE\" or \"the next SHIB\", not DOGE or SHIB. So once new investors believe that the project has already had its big pump, they move on to the next one. Because anyone looking to invest in memecoins for the big money gains will invest into the newly rising memecoin that has yet to pump, not that ones that have already had their day.",

You also only have to buy into BTC once, unlike a 401K where most people keep buying back in every pay check only to lose what you earned in interest by paying a penalty if you withdraw too early.   Because that's the trick.  The trick to a 401K is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells, then everyone else who didn't sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash.    That's why they charge penalities.    \n\nIt's like investing in safemoon and they charge you penalities for selling In order to keep the current value more stable so the entirety of holders don't start panic selling it into oblivion.\n\nAlso you can panic sell a 401K too.  It happened to many people after the housing market crash of 2008.    My mom panic sold her 401k because it went from $50K to $9K ...I didn't know much about investing back then, but I will never forget what she said.  *I was afraid I would lose it all, it kept going down* \n\nWhat she said sounds much like what people say about Bitcoin today. \n\nNowadays my mom is retired, and sometimes she brings that up...*I should've just kept it in...it went back up*\n\nUnfortunately this is how the most powerful people work.  They shake out weak hands so they can buy up super low.   Otherwise there would be no big guy buying your shit back.  \n\nRich are buying your shit cheap for a reason...not just because they are just speculating. \n\n\nSo yeah, you can get serious FUD with 401K and it's not just coming from my mom. Many honest hard working people don't understand the game whales play...they get shilled into things and are convinced it's safe because their employer offers it.    All a 401K is, is investments into stocks and bonds that are stable but not always safe. \n\nSo if you can continually dump every paycheck into something that penalizes you for withdrawing early and hold that shit for 30 years , then you can buy Bitcoin  once and hold it for 3 years without any penality for withdrawing some too early unless tax on capital gains. But that's normal. \n\nSo stick to your original plan, and hold.",

    "postText": "If you are a student, focus on your studies. I am 30+ yo now. I used to be a student 10 years ago. Now I have a decent job. \nI can't help but think in which mindset are students who lately made some quick gains. If you did take some gains, I can only congratulate you, you probably did better than most of your student peers who are probably not fully aware of what crypto is.\n\nBut be aware that once you make your first gains, there is something I call the \"casino effect\". It pushes you to take more and more risks. I think it can be even amplified as a student because most of you don't have yet a monthly income. I remember that each penny counts and insane gains can start turning your head. At the same time, you are in the period of your life when you need to make very important decisions.\n\nLately, you might read about young Samsung employees quitting their jobs in South Korea thanks to millions of $ they earned in crypto. Or read cool posts about huge gains and lambo.\nAnd you might think there is no good reason to study anymore.\nStrangely there is not much about people ashamed of massive losses.\n\nMy message is for you to keep in mind you must measure your risk. Crypto is great but who knows when the rollercoaster ends or when you will make bad moves (we all do). You can not rely only on that. Hopefully the recent dip made you realize that. Please treat your study as your top priority and crypto as a bonus. If you make it in crypto, that would be amazing. If not, you still have a diploma and a good option in life.\n\n- Crypto = great\n- Crypto + job = better\n\nDon't gamble on your life. Don't have regrets. Decision is only yours.\n\nYour crypto older brother who wish you good in life.",

    "postText": "If you've invested in an altcoin and you've doubled your money, take out your initial investment. Then you're playing with house money. The title pretty much says it all. Whether you're throwing your money at the latest meme coin or you've spent a lot of time DYOR on some promising project, it's a good time to remind people that 90+% of these projects simply will not make it.\n\nMaybe they die completely, or maybe they just linger at the fringe like some projects have, just crabbing sideways (or downward) for years.\n\nSo a good idea is to, whenever your favorite crypto doubles, take out your initial investment. Yes, it could keep going up and you'd miss out on those gains, but it could also go down and you'd lose everything. \n\nOnce you've taken back your initial investment though, you are playing with free money. You'd be surprised just how relaxing it is to check the charts on a \"free money\" crypto and not really care if the latest candle is red or green.\n\nA good strategy is to continue doing the same thing every time that coin doubles. Take out half, leave the other half invested. Rinse and repeat. It's a super easy way to always know when you should be taking profits along the way, and also a way to always have dry powder to buy into any available price dips.",

Of course I am speaking of popular and trustworthy exchanges. Leaving your crypto on an exchange nobody has ever heard of is of course a dumb idea.\n\nBut do you want to tell me that your crypto is not safe on Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com or Voyager? It is 2021 and not 2014 and these exchanges can not be compared to Mt Gox.\n\nAlso sometimes people get the whole \"not your keys, not your crypto\" thing too seriously. I have seen people here complainig that they lost a big amount of their ETH to move it to a cold wallet. Well, high gas fees are another topic but you definitely shouldn't move your crypto to a wallet if you have to lose like 1/4 of it to do that. If you just have 0.05 ETH or similar then just leave it on the exchange. Nothing will happen to it.\n\nNot to mention that if you are new in crypto then it is more likely for you to lose your piece of paper with your seed phrase than an exchange like Kraken or Coinbase to get hacked. If you ever accumulate a bigger amount of crypto then you could think about buying a cold wallet!\n\nPS I originally [posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/phepj2/no_leaving_your_crypto_on_an_exchange_is_not_the/) on friday but it got deleted for mentioning ETH in the title because there were already many posts about ETH.

Thanks for everyone's feedback.**\n\nChanges:\n\n1. Certain coins are easier to see\n2. Some categories moved for less confusion, e.g. privacy coins are now under currency along with stablecoins.\n3. Icons have been added for ERC20, BEP2/BEP20, and Forks\n4. Some descriptions changed slightly for accuracies\n5. Some typos fixed (e.g. USDC instead of CSDC)\n6. Stellar moved out of the distributed computing category as it doens't offer an on-chain programming language or on-chain smart contracts, it now bridges the currency and finance categories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldgh69f4ioc71.png?width=1690&format=png&auto=webp&s=61f1cf41a1f8d9f912507a5c3971e4434189a21e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2: Thanks for all the fantastic feedback and awards. I'm working on a version 2 which will address some of the issues people have had.\n\n1. Certain coins hard to find/unclear\n2. I didn't intend for privacy coins to look like it was a subset of store of value, however it looks like people are interpreting it that way. I am going to move it under currency and change a few things round so similar categories are grouped together.\n3. Thinking of adding icons next to coins indicating additional properties of that coin, e.g. ERC20 token, BSC20 token, Fork of bitcoin\n4. Description of DeFi section is off, because some of the projects are centralised, so am changing it to just 'financial services'\n5. Various small typos/capital letter inconsistencies.\n6. Changing Stellar/XLM to just currency, and possibly make it part of the DeFi group, as the smart contracts are not executed on chain, and so it can't really be considered distributed computing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e63xzwctjc71.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=12514060a09a160f1eb12d40436c0020e6018ffe",

Great time to stock up on crypto at a major discount.

Maybe take profits next time so you\u2019ll have spending money on the next dip. \n\nAnyone else get any good deals or catch the drop? Good luck everyone!\n\nEDIT: This is a good time to talk about a strategy I have. If you take profits you take them and convert to USDC. Then send them to Celsius, blockfi or crypto and let them earn interest. If a crash like this happens, you transfer them out and buy the dip.",

    "postText": "When every crash is a \"dip\" and every bounce is a \"we have liftoff\" -- that's how a frog gets boiled to death. 2017 Crumbs of Wisdom thread for Bull Runs. Like many of you, I got burned by hodling too long through 2017/2018. \"Hodl\" is a stupid meme for newbs. I learned the hard way.\n\nSo called \"fundamentals\" ('solid team', 'awesome project', 'upcoming partnerships')  don't reflect the price in a company that received its funding before it has ever proven anything (that's the primary difference between an ICO and an IPO). ***Where my REQ marines at?***\n\nWhen this bull run is actually over (and personally i don't believe that it is yet), you probably won't come to accept it until your portfolio is sitting at 50% of its ATH and your \"stack\" of crypto has become a \"bag\" you're stuck holding \"until you reach XX number again--then you'll sell *for sure*.\"\n\nHere's the reality: Once the bubble pops, every crash is going to seem like a \"dip\" and every \"bounce\" is going feel like a \"this is gentlemen.\"  ***That's how frogs get boiled to death.***\n\nHere are some principles you need to keep in mind if you want to walk away from this bull run with a fat stack of cash:\n\n1. Recognize and accept that you won't sell the exact top, and that--subsequently--your portfolio's \"true value\" is only what you sell it for--not what it's ATH was at one point.\n2. Pick a realistic sum (take your dream figure and subtract 50%) at which you're going to cash out a certain percentage--or all of it--and (here's the important part): ***STICK TO IT.***\n   1. This latter point is most crucial, because as the sum grows and actually hits that number you picked, you're going to be very tempted to leave it in \"just a little longer\". That's greed talking. If you ask Greed \"how much is enough?\" the answer is always \"a little bit more.\" Have discipline in this and you'll win. Let greed take over and you'll lose. *If you let greed govern your decisions in a bull market, then you'll let panic govern your decisions in a bear market.*\n3. You can't predict the future--so don't judge your past self for knowledge you have today. \"Why didn't i buy that coin?!?! it just mooned!\" Or \"Why didn't i sell before it crashed?!\" You know what happened yesterday because it's today--you can't get mad at yourself for not possessing today's knowledge on the day before yesterday.\n4. My final and **MOST IMPORTANT** point:\n   1. As I said before ***your portfolio is only worth what you actually sell it for***. So do **NOT** focus on ***how much it was*** or ***how much it could have been*** \\-- if you make this mistake you will be dissatisfied at turning $1000 into $100,000. If you've only got a $1,000 right now, you're probably thinking \"of course i'd be happy with $100k!\" -- but when you get there you'll be holding out for 200/300/1 million. In your greed, you won't be satisfied with an enormous return--especially if you keep thinking about how you could have had $1,000,000 if you just \"bought that dip\" that no one saw coming or \"held xyz coin\" a little bit longer.  ***Focus on what you have today--not what you might have tomorrow.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrypto veterans what other wisdom do you want to add to this list?\n\nEdit: Some people here seem to think that because BTC is now worth $55k that it would have been dumb to sell at $20k...in 2017. Obviously those are not people interested in making money, and this post is clearly not for them.",

It\u2019s a constant occurrence to see people freaking out when a coin starts pumping, and they aren\u2019t in it, and the coins start dumping and they want to sell it.\n\nYoutubers are constantly saying \u201cthis is just FUD\u201d, and \u201cthe Bull market is not over\u201d, and \u201cBuy the dip\u201d. But the problem is that A LOT of the FUD that newcomers feel, actually come from the crappy Youtubers, with their shitty \u201c\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\u201d thumbnails.\n\nImagine you finally bought some Bitcoin, maybe you bought it at 60k, and you see the market going 10% down. You invested in crypto, and it\u2019s your first experience with volatility.\n\nYou go to YouTube, and your homepage is now flooded with \u201cTHE MARKET IS TANKING \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\u201d \u201cBITCOIN BEAR MARKET\u201d.\n\nHow do you think this would make you feel if you just came to the cryptocurrency market? I personally would feel a lot of fear, and try to cut my losses, as I wouldn\u2019t know what any of this meant. Now I take a loss, and the market starts going up, and then I buy...and the cycle continues. It\u2019s the meme of buy high, sell low...but although it is a joke, it does happen to a lot of people.\n\nWe need to help the people that feel this way, by giving them reassurance. By not letting their emotions take over. I try to do this on the daily discussion, and maybe if you read this far, you could also jump in sometimes.\n\nHope everyone has a lovely weekend!",

    "postText": "The ultimate guide to earning passive income with cryptocurrencies \ud83d\udccc Most of us are here to make money. Some people try trading, while others just HODL and check the prices every 5 minutes. And even though many of us have made decent amounts, neither of these two ways can guarantee a reliable source of income.\n\nBut what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.\n\n# #1 - Staking\n\nStaking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.\n\nStaking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.\n\nYou can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.\n\n# #2 - Airdrops\n\nAn airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.\n\nThe famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth \u2248 $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.\n\nIt is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)\n\n# #3 - Reddit Moons\n\nMost of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?\n\n\"Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.\n\nAs blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you\u2019ve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They\u2019re all yours.\"\n\nIn order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).\n\nThe main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.\n\nTo sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!\n\nIn case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.\n\n# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.\n\nThis method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.\n\nWhile the saying \"not your keys, not your coins\" is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.\n\nIf you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.\n\n# #5 - Coinbase Earn\n\nNot a \"passive\" method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the \"It ain't much, but it's honest work\" meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.\n\nIn my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.\n\nCompared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you have any other suggestions or feel like sharing your experience on passive income and cryptocurrencies, feel free to do that! :)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The above references are an opinion and are for information purposes only.

    "postTitle": "Investing in Crypto with Low Income: How I've been doing it",
    "postText": "Investing in Crypto with Low Income: How I've been doing it I'm from a 3rd world country with a very unstable economy and hyper inflated currency. I got into cryptocurrency at the beginning of COVID because I lost my job and there were no other jobs available, so I did some research and saw how fiat and will of governments are the major reason my people suffer this much and also how crypto can help bypass these restrictions.\n\nSo, after doing research and calculating electricity costs and gains, I invested most of my savings into a small mining rig which ended up earning me more money per month than my previous job because the price of ETH got better. For reference I was making 110$ per month from my job, but I was earning roughly 160$ from mining every month. I found another job recently, but for quite some time, mining was my primary source of income. Now I roughly earn 300$ per month, mining + my job.\n\nAnyway the reason I brought this up was to show how little I was earning and how I still managed to invest in crypto. Usually investing requires a large amount of initial capital (Such as stocks and property), which many people don't have, but crypto doesn't have any such barrier. I started spending less and less on things I didn't really need. Smoking, drinking, occasional drug use (marijuana) and ordering food all the time. These can be anything, for me it was these things. Some people spend excessive money on collectible, games, clothing etc... So its up to each individual to find out what is their needless spending.\n\nI quit smoking, drugs and alcohol and started cooking more. This allowed me to invest around 1$ per day in BTC or coin of my choice. Sometimes I simply held onto my ETH instead of selling it, and sometimes I bought another coin. But as I said, it was around 30$ a month. It's basically nothing in terms of international value, but it was decent amount of money for me (inflation is a bitch) and now depending on the coin I invested in, I have profits in almost all of them. Even though I convert most of my mining into fiat to spend on bills and costs of living, every investment I made I've been hodling ever since. It didn't make me rich or anything, but now I have basically tripled my investments and have more in savings than I ever did.\n\nWhich one are you more likely to regret more:\n\n1. I could have spent the whole year smoking and drinking, and eating bad food, but I didn't\n2. I could have spent the whole year investing in crypto and living a healthier life, but I didn't\n\nIn fact, with my savings, I would feel less terrible for indulging in things I quit now and then, because its no longer a big economic drain like it used to be and we are all human, so we do deserve some leisure spending. Its all thanks to that crucial year of investing.\n\nI recommend everyone to do their own research, but I still believe it's early enough to invest a small amount of your income in crypto every month, hodl and see profits long term. My mother thinks I am some kind of genius for tripling our savings, but she simply doesn't understand the concept of crypto. In reality, I was just following crypto info on my 2nd monitor while gaming and not spending money on things I didn't need. I am no genius. Crypto simply provides investment opportunities to people who don't have large initial capital to invest in traditional investment avenues.\n\nI hope this has been helpful to other people with low income, specially others who are also from countries that have unstable economy and inflated currencies. Even 1%-5% of your monthly income in crypto is a good long term investment, but as always do your own research and pick your coins. I didn't do \"day trading\" or try to invest in new coins, hoping they would go up. I mainly invested in coins that were solid already. I would suggest the same for fellow low income investors. In the end this has been my experience, and I thought I should share it. And don't forget, this is just for one year. The more we hold, the better. Finally, even if we don't make it, we have merely sacrificed unnecessary things in our lives, we still have the friends and connections we made along the way.\n\nP.S: Happy new year and Nowruz to everyone who follow Iranian/Zoroastrian solar calendar around the world! The equinox is upon us and spring has sprung! Happy first day of spring.\n\nEdit: Thanks a lot for all the rewards and support! I would love to message each one of you to thank you individually, but there is so many of you! Thank you very much for all the support.",

The user has since confirmed as much in a message to the moderation team.

Rule 3 is \"No Manipulation\" and that counts for bypassing Governance rules for the subreddit.\n\n**It is not fair for the rest of the users who are following the rules to have these moons distributed for ill-gotten karma, especially not over several accounts.**\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the moons these accounts have received cannot be recovered (the beauty of trustless, blockchain technology) but we can at least act now to prevent this final distribution from rewarding this user for their bad-faith posting. If this karma is removed from the distribution, the current ratio will increase, giving each and every user more moons for their karma this round  This will be a record-setting poll if it passes, and it is a long shot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy this poll passing, it will remove the above accounts from the current distribution, ensuring they do not receive the final moons allocated for their posts in snapshot 17. The methodology to address problem users has been laid out by Reddit admins.\n\nAn additional effect of the poll passing will be less karma in the pool, meaning the Karma:Moons ratio goes up - more moons for everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pjxnut)",

Here's the facts. \n\nWe live in one of the most expensive cities in North america. Average two/three bedroom townhouse here is about 900k. We have finally saved up 15% of a down payment (other 5% covered) and we would love to get into the market before our family expands and before the inevitable interest rate hikes in the new year.\n\nMost of the holding is in ETH. We're kind of going sideways with price right now but I would still cover the down payment if I pulled today at a recent low (4800cdn). \n\nMy question is, if even 1% of an interest rate hike means an extra $100k on a mortgage, is holding for 6 months to a year to see a possible 10K eth a smart move? Am I basically gaining more crypto but paying more for a house as the rates go up? \n\nI feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

    "postText": "Want to start fresh after the crypto crash? Here is a comprehensive guide on how to invest and prosper over the long term. Well its happened, the crypto market just experienced the worst crash since 2014, the bubble has burst. [The idiocy of newbies FOMO-ing into anything with low nominal value lead to endless twitter timelines like this](https://i.imgur.com/zDjmRjl.jpg), and now nobody has any idea where the market settles. What do you do now? \n\nIn the following weeks it will be a good time to rethink your investment approach and how you arrive at your decisions. Just buying whatever is shilled on Twitter or Reddit and jumping from one crypto to another isn't going to work like it did these last two months. \n\nThe good news is that we're finally back closer and closer to our long term moving average which is much more healthy for entrants, the bad news is that the fear might continue compounding if outstanding issues are not dealt with. [Tether is the big concern for me personally for reasons I've stated many times](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tg8fn/tether_drama_tether_has_dissolved_relationship/dtco50g/), but some relief in the short term may come if the SEC and CFTC meeting on February 6th goes well. Nobody really knows where the bottom is but I think we're now past the \"irrational exhuberance\" stage and we're entering a period of more serious inspection where cryptos will actually have to prove themselves as useful. I suspect hype artists like CryptoNick and John McAfee will fall out of favor.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly use this as a learning experience, don't try to point fingers now. The type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was rewarded in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a shillcoin, following hype..etc) could only ever lead to what we are experiencing now. Just like so many people jumped on the crypto bandwagon during the bull run, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon is to be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble. Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case will accept that they themselves with their own investing behavior were the real reason for the gross overvaluation of most cryptocurrencies, and the inevitable crash.\n\nSo if you're looking for a fresh start after the massacre (or just want to get in now), here is a guide:\n\n#Part A: Making a Investment Strategy\n---------------------------\n\nThis is your money, put some effort into investing it with an actual strategy. Some simple yet essential advice that should apply to everyone, regardless of individual strategy:\n\n1. Slow down and research each crypto that you're buying for at least a week.\n\n2. Don't buy something just because it has risen.\n\n3. Don't exit a position just because it has declined.\n\n4. Invest only as much as you can afford to lose.\n\n5. Prepare enter and exit strategies in advance. \n\nFirst take some time to think about your ROI target, set your hold periods for each position and how much you are actually ready to risk losing.\n\n**ROI targets**\n\nA lot of young investors who are in crypto have unrealistic expectations about returns and risk. A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 5-10% ROI in a month to be unexciting. \n\nBut its important to temper your hype and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year and how unlikely it is that we see 10x returns in the next year. What we saw recently was [Greater Fool Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) in action. Those unexciting returns of 5-10% a month are much more of the norm, and much more healthy for an alternative investment class. \n\nYou can think about setting a target in terms of the market ROI over a relevant holding period and then add or decrease based on your own risk profile.\n\n**Example: Calculating a 2 year ROI target**\n\nLets say you want to hold for 2 years now, how could you set a realistic target to strive for? You could look at a historical 2 year return as a base, preferably during a period similar to what we're facing now. Now that we had a major correction, I think we can look at the two year period starting in 2015 after we had the 2014 crash. To calculate a 2 year CAGR starting in 2015:\n\nYear  | Total Crypto Market Cap \n-------|------\nJan 1, 2015:|  $5.5 billion \nJan 1, 2017:  | $18 billion\n\nCompounded annual growth return (CAGR):  [(18/5.5)^(1/2)]-1 = 81%\n\nThis annual return rate of 81% comes out to about 4.9% compounded monthly. This may not sound exciting to the lambo moon crowd, but it will keep you grounded in reality. You can aim for a higher return (say 2x of that 81% rate) if you choose to take on more risky propositions. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. \n\nOnce you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio based on your target.\n\n**Risk Management**\n\nEverything you buy in crypto is risky, but it still helps to think of these 3 risk categories:\n\n* Core holdings - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. The Coinbase pairs (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum) are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero.\n\n* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have a working product and niche, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash and Ripple, relatively established history but still uncertainty over long term viability.\n\n* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, ICOs, low caps, shillcoins...etc. Most cryptos are in this category.\n\nHow much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation for one, but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. \n\nThe general starting point I would recommend is: \n\n* 50-70% for newbies in Low Risk Core, then you can go down to 30% as you gains confidence and experience\n\n* Always try to keep at least a 1/3rd in safe core positions\n\n* Don't go all in on speculative picks.\n\nSome more core principles on risk management to consider:\n\n* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. \n\n* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.\n\n* Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.\n\n* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.\n\n* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing mode.\n\n* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback. This should be part of your entry strategy.\n\n* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.\n\n\nYou can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm), but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).\n\nRt = Rm +Ri\n\nThe market risk is something you cannot avoid, it is essentially the risk that is carried by the entire market over things like regulations. What you can minimize though the Ri, the specific risks with your crypto. That will depend on the team composition, geographic risks (for example Chinese coins like NEO carry regulatory risks specific to China), competition within the space and likelihood of adoption and other factors, which I'll describe in Part 2: Crypto Picking Methodology.\n\n\n**Portfolio Allocation**\n\nAlong with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:\n\n* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc\n\n* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc\n\n* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc\n\n* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc\n\n* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment - VeChain, Walton, Factom...etc\n\n* Promising Tech segment - NANO/Raiblock, Cardano...etc\n\nThink about your [\"Circle of Competence\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Your ability to properly judge risk and potential is going to largely correlated to your understanding of the subject matter. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? If you don't understand anything about the tech when you read the Cardano paper, are you really able to determine how likely it is to be adopted?\n\nConsider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. \n\nYou should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you have over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. \n\n\n#Part B: Crypto Picking Methodology (Due Dilligence)\n------------------------------------------\n\nDo you struggle on how to fundamentally analyze cryptocurrencies? Here is a 3-step methodology to follow to perform your due dilligence:\n\n# Step 1: Filtering and Research\n\nThere is so much out there that you can get overwhelmed. The best way to start is to think back to your own portfolio allocation strategy and what you would like to get more off. For example in my view enterprise-focused blockchain solutions will be important in the next few years, and so I look to create a list of various cryptos that are in that segment.\n\n[Upfolio has brief descriptions of the top 100 cryptos and is filterable by categories](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained), for example you can click the \"Enterprise\" category and you have a neat list of VEN, FCT, WTC...etc.\n\nOnce you have a list of potential candidates, its time to read about them:\n\n* Critically evaluate the website. If it's a cocktail of nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and poorly made, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. \n\n* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. \n\n* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts selling? Try to figure out who the whales are (not always easy!) and what the foundation/founder account is based on the initial allocation.\n\n* Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?\n\n* Search out the subreddit and look at a few Medium or Steem blogs about the coin. How \"shilly\" is the community, and how much engagement is there between developer and the community?\n\n* I would also go through the BitcoinTalk thread and Twitter mentions, judge both the length and quality of the discussion.\n\nYou can actually filter out a lot of scams and bad investments by simply keeping your eye out on the following red flags:\n\n* allocations that give way too much to the founder\n\n* guaranteed promises of returns (Bitcooonnneeeect!)\n\n* vague whitepapers filled with buzzwords\n\n* vague timelines and no clear use case\n\n* Github with no useful code and sparse activity\n\n* a team that is difficult to find information on \n\n#Step 2: Passing a potential pick through a checklist\n\nOnce you feel fairly confident that a pick is worth analyzing further, run them through a standardized checklist of questions. This is one I use, you can add other questions yourself:\n\nCrypto Analysis Checklist |\n---------|\nWhat is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? |\nWhat is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized? |\nHow big is the market they're targeting? |\nWho is their competition and what does it do better? |\nWhat is the roadmap they created and how well have they kept to it? |\nWhat current product exists? |\nHow does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? |\nIs there any new tech, and is it informational or governance based? |\nCan it be easily copied? |\nWhat are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?  |\n\nThe last question is the most important. \n\nThis is where the riskiness of your crypto is evaluated, the Ri I talked about above. Here you should be able to accurate place the crypto into one of the three risk categories. I also like to run through this checklist of blockchain benefits and consider which specific properties of the blockchain are being used by the specific crypto to provide some increased utility over the current transactional method:\n\nBenefits of Cryptocurrency |\n---------|\nDecentralization - no need for a third party to agree or validate transactions. |\nTransparency and trust - As blockchain are shared, everyone can see what transactions occur. Useful for something like an online casino. |\nImmutability - It is extremely difficult to change a transaction once its been put onto a blockchain |\nDistributed availability - The system is spread on thousands of nodes on a P2P network, so its difficult to take the system down. |\nSecurity - cryptographically secured transactions provide integrity |\nSimplification and consolidation - a blockchain can serve as a shared ledger in industries where multiple entities previously kept their own data sources |\nQuicker Settlement - In the financial industry when we're dealing with post-trade settlement, a blockchain can drastically increase the speed of verification |\nCost - in some cases avoiding a third party verification would drastically reduce costs. |\n\n\n#Step 3: Create a valuation model\n\nYou don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:\n\n**Probablistic Scenario Valuation**\n\nThis is all about thinking of scenarios and probability, a helpful exercise in itself. For example: Bill Miller, a prominent value investor, [wrote a probabilistic valuation case for Bitcoin in 2015](http://dev.lmminvestments.com/a-value-investors-case-for-bitcoin/). He looked at two possible scenarios for probabalistic valuation:\n\n1. becoming a store-of-value equal to gold (a $6.4 trillion value), with a .25% probability of occurring\n2.  replacing payment processors like VISA, MasterCard, etc. (a $350 million dollar value) with a 2.5% probability\n\nCombining those scenarios would give you the total expected market cap: (0.25% x 6.4 trillion) + (2.5% x 350 million). Divide this by the outstanding supply and you have your valuation.\n\n\n**Metcalfe's Law**\n\n[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. We can alter this to crypto by thinking about it in terms of both users and transactions:\n\nFor example, compare the Coinbase pairs:\n\nMetric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin\n---------|----------|----------|----------\nMarket Cap | $152 Billion | $93 Billion | $7.3 Billion\nDaily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 249,851| 1,051,427 | 70,397\nActive Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000\nMetcalfe Ratio (Transactions Based)| 2.43 | 0.08 | 1.47\nMetcalfe Ratio (Address Based)| 0.12| 0.09 | 0.03\n\nGenerally the higher the ratio, the higher the valuation given for each address/transaction.\n\n**Market Cap to Industry comparisons**\n\nAnother easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. \n\n**More complex valuation models**\n\nIf you would like to get into more fleshed out models with Excel, I highly recommend Chris Burniske's blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an [equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto](https://medium.com/@cburniske).\n\n[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done by Nodar Janashia using Chris' model ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit). \n\nYou should create multiple scenarios with multiple assumptions, both positive and negative. Have a base scenario and then moderately optimistic/pessimistic and highly optimistic/pessimistic scenario.\n\nPersonally I like to see at least a 50% upward potential before investing from my moderately pessimistic scenario, but you can set your own safety margin.\n\nThe real beneficial thing about modelling isn't even the price or valuation comparisons it spits out, but that it forces you to think about why the coin has value and what your own assumption about the future are. For example the discount rate you apply to the net present utility formula drastically affects the valuation, and it reflects your own assumptions of how risky the crypto is. What exactly would be a reasonable discount rate? What about the digital economy you are assuming for the coin, what levers affects its size and adoption and how likely are your assumptions to come true? You'll be a drastically more intelligent investor if you think about the fundamental variables that give your coin the market cap you think it should hold.\n\n\n#Summing it up\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe time for lambo psychosis is over. But that's no reason to feel down, this is a new day and what many were waiting for. I've put together in one place here how to construct a portfolio allocation (taking into consideration risk and return targets), and how to go through a systematic crypto picking method. I'm won't tell you what to buy, you should always decide that for yourself and DYOR. But as long as you follow a rational and thorough methodology (feel free to modify anything I said above to suit your own needs) you will feel pretty good about your investments, even in times like these. \n\n\nEdit: Also get a [crypto prediction ferret](https://i.imgur.com/ZEJqZHf.jpg). You won't regret it.",

    "postText": "A crash course on what changing the US bond rate means, and why it is considered such an important factor for US and global markets and economies # Intro\n\nYesterday, somebody in the comments of some thread asked for an ELI5 on why US bond rates matter and what their relationship is with markets and economies. What I wrote ended up being more like an ELI12, and also ended up being quite long; in any case, I have decided to modify it a bit and turn it into its own post.\n\n# What are bonds\n\nFirst, an introduction on what bonds actually are.\n\nSimply put, a bond is the \"asset side\" of governmental or corporate debt. When a government or corporation borrows money, the borrower now holds a liability, and the lender holds an asset, which is expected to return them their original investment (the money they lent) plus profit (interest) at some later date. A bond is basically a token that says some government or company owes you some amount of principal by some date known as the maturity date (usually 3 months to 30 years, depending on the type of bond), plus interest. Because bonds are a tokenization of debt, they can be easily traded in a liquid, open market, just like stocks. This means that the original lender does not need to be the person who is repaid when the bond matures; the repayment and interest simply goes to whomever holds the bond at the time.\n\nThere are two main types of bonds: corporate bonds, and government bonds.\n\nCorporate bonds are the main way companies raise money, apart from selling shares.\n\nGovernment bonds are how the government raises money to cover budget deficits (ie: when the government spends more than they have the tax revenue to spend, they borrow the remainder by selling bonds to whomever will buy them). If nobody is buying the government bonds, the interest will go up organically due to supply and demand until people are willing to buy them. Government bonds are often known as **treasuries**, and are broken down into three categories: treasury bills (short-term maturity), treasury notes (mid-term maturity), and treasury bonds (long-term maturity).\n\nOne of the main buyers of US government bonds is the Federal Reserve, which is the name of America's central bank. This is the entity that is able to actually print US dollars. Everyone has heard of things like how the US government recently ran huge deficits due to \"stimulus spending\", and that it printed the money it needed for that spending. Well, this is a slightly inaccurate picture of how it works. The government chooses fiscal policy, which means they build the budget and they set the tax rates. They are the ones who choose to overspend and run a deficit. However, they don't choose monetary policy: they cannot print money. This power was delegated by congress to the Federal Reserve over 100 years ago.\n\nSo, when the government runs a deficit, they sell bonds to borrow the money. If the FED chooses to, it can print a whole bunch of money and then lend that money to the government (ie: the taxpayer) by buying the government bonds with it. That is how newly printed money actually gets into the economy: the FED prints it and then lends it out to companies and to the government by buying corporate and government bonds. When the FED buys a bunch of treasuries (government bonds), it is really lending out freshly-printed cash to the American people (since the government's liabilities are really the taxpayers' liabilities), and the people then owe that money, with interest, back to the FED by the time the treasury matures.\n\nWhen the FED decides to buy up the government's bonds in order to lend to the taxpayers the money that congress is spending, they are also putting downward pressure on the bond interest rate. This is because, if the FED decided *not* to lend a bunch of money to the government to cover its deficits, the bond interest would organically rise through supply & demand until other buyers (individuals, companies, foreign investors, whatever) are willing to buy those bonds.\n\nSo, when the FED wants to keep bond interest low, they achieve this indirectly by creating what is basically artificial demand for US bonds by buying a ton of them with money that they printed at no cost to themselves. Due to how supply & demand works with debt, the more demand there is for bonds, the lower the interest those bonds offer.\n\nSo, the Federal Reserve executes its main task of managing the US bond rate by choosing how much government debt it buys. If they want bond rates to go up, they will print less cash and buy fewer bonds. If they want it to go down, they will print more cash and buy more bonds.\n\nThe FED is essentially a whale with the power to print money, who uses said printed money to manipulate the US bond market, ostensibly for the good of everybody.\n\n# The risk-free rate\n\nThe interest rate on American government bonds is considered one of the most important variables in the American (and even worldwide) economy. This is because the American gov is considered the de-facto safest borrower of all borrowers in the world. In other words, if I buy an American government bond, I am lending my money to the entity that is considered to have the smallest risk of defaulting in the world (maybe this is arguable, but regardless this is a premise that is at the core of the world economy; what's important is that people believe it).\n\nThere is a concept in economics called the \"risk-free rate\". This is the interest you can get for lending your money to a 0-risk borrower, and should logically be the lowest interest rate you see anywhere in that economy. Of course, there is always technically some risk when you lend money, so the risk-free rate is technically imaginary. However, in practice, just about everybody considers the US bond rate (specifically, treasury bills, the US bond with the shortest maturity) to be the risk-free rate, as the risk is considered to be so low as to be negligible.\n\nSo, if buying American gov bonds is the safest way to lend money, it means that every single other form of loan must pay higher interest. Why? Because every other borrower is considered higher risk, and for me as a lender, I will not accept less interest for greater risk. So, if American bond interest goes up, all other loan interest (corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgages, credit cards, whatever) will organically go up, because everything must pay greater interest than American bonds to compensate for greater risk. This is simply a matter of supply & demand mechanics.\n\nSo, American bond interest is kind of like the baseline or the \"sea level\" for all interest rates in the entire economy. This even stretches to other countries, because anyone can buy a bond from the US gov, and they are considered the safest borrower in the world, so nobody will ever lend money to anybody else unless they are compensated with greater interest than US bond interest.\n\n# The cost of capital\n\nSo, if US bond rates go up, and therefore all interest in the economy goes up, that means money itself has gotten more expensive. Loan interest is literally just the cost of money (known as the cost of capital). The lesser the interest, the cheaper it is for me to acquire money right now. When you realize that the entire world runs mainly on debt, it becomes clear how significant this phenomenon is.\n\nSo, when US bond rates go up, the price of capital itself goes up. That means it becomes more costly for businesses to raise money, more costly to mortgage a house, more costly to open a line of credit to buy investments, more costly to spend with credit cards, more costly to use leverage in securities markets, etc.\n\nThis means that growth goes down, spending goes down, wages go down, etc. It also means the prices of goods go down (or at least climb slower), because people aren't willing to pay as much, since capital itself is more expensive to acquire.\n\nWhat happens when prices go down? Well, that's a reduction in inflation. So, when inflation is getting too high, the FED (central bank) will make bond interest go up to apply recessive forces on the economy to curb said inflation.\n\nIf inflation is low, the FED might reduce bond interest in order to make the cost of capital lower to juice the economy, prop up securities markets, and incentivize growth. Too much growth though, and we end up with inflation again, meaning the FED might increase rates again. This causes a sort of wave-like dance between bond rates and the heat of the economy.\n\nSo, the FED influences bond rates ostensibly to keep the economy balanced: not too hot and inflationary (can be very bad) and not too cold and deflationary (also can be very bad).\n\nIt is also worth noting that the FED wields a couple other levers it can use to increase or decrease the cost of capital (ie: the general interest rates in the economy) that are separate from bond rates. They can change the reserve requirements of banks (what percentage of total assets a bank must hold in reserve). If banks need to hold more in reserve, then they have less liquid money to lend out, so the supply of capital goes down, so market interest (cost of capital) rises. Also, the FED can change the discount rate, which is the amount of interest they charge banks for short-term loans (24 hours or less) from the FED itself.  When these rates go up, banks are disincentivized from borrowing from the FED, so the banks end up with less liquid capital, which means they need to be more conservative about the loans they themselves give out, which makes the supply of capital go down and thus the cost of capital go up.\n\n# What does this mean for markets?\n\nWhen bond rates go up, most investment markets go down. Why? Well, the higher bond rates go, the more I can make by investing in bonds, without the risk going up. So, as bond rates go up, it becomes more and more attractive to move my wealth out of riskier markets like stocks and into what is considered the safest investment market in the world: US bonds. Since rates going up means I get greater returns on my bond investments, but the risk doesn't change, US gov bonds become more and more sensible to an investor as the rates increase.\n\nOf course, bonds rates going up a smidgen doesn't actually suddenly make bonds a strategically more sound investment than riskier things like stocks. In fact, US bond rates have been so comically low for so long that it hasn't made much sense to buy bonds in years (decades, really). However, when people hear that the FED is going to increase bond rates, they think \"bond rates going up means people will sell stocks to buy bonds, so I better sell now to front-run that\", which is the main thing that *actually* causes stocks to fall when bond rates increase.\n\nHow crypto will fare with increasing bond rates is unknown, because rates have been declining ever since BTC was born, until very recently. Personally, I imagine crypto will follow stocks down if rates go up too much, but nobody knows for sure.\n\n# Some historical context\n\nUS bond rates hit an ATH in 1981 around 15% (edit: some sources seem to say 20%; unsure which is correct). Unsurprisingly, the stock market hit a low at the same time (like I said before, the orthodox narrative is that there is an inverse relationship between bond rates and most securities markets). Think about how ridiculous 15% bond rates are. That would mean you could buy what is definitionally the safest investment available and get 15% returns each year. By contrast, the safest stock ETFs (still way riskier than US bonds) average like 7% a year.\n\nSo, in the 80s, you could double your money every 5 years while accepting what is usually considered 0 risk. Ever wonder why boomers seemed to get wealthy so easily? This is one of the reasons.\n\nSince the ATH in 1981, the treasury bond rate has fallen continuously until Covid hit, at which point it pivoted at a low of about 0.5%. Since then, it has been going back up, but is still extremely low, at around 1.5%.\n\nSince bond rates going down means stocks go up (at least, this is a very popular narrative, though some disagree), the stock market has been in a tremendous and arguably unnatural bull run for about 40 years, only pausing twice very briefly for \"corrections\" circa 1999 and 2008.\n\nSince US bond rates have gotten so close to 0%, they can't really lower them any further without going negative (which is actually a thing, and some countries are trying negative interest now. This is an extremely weird rabbit hole that nobody really knows the true consequences of yet. Imagine getting paid to borrow money. Several countries have been experimenting with this over the last 7 years, and a few I believe for even longer). The chair of the FED (Jerome Powell) said a few months back that they have no intention of going to negative interest rates, so that means these past 40 years of propping up markets by reducing bond rates has probably come to an end.\n\nYou could think of the continuous lowering of rates for the last 40 years as the FED spending its ammunition to prop up markets and propel economic growth, but now that rates are barely above 0% and the FED isn't willing to go negative, they are out of ammo. Not only are they out of ammo when it comes to lowering the rates, but one might also argue they are also currently incentivized to *increase* rates to combat rising inflation.\n\nThis is why there is fear. The FED has been sticking its hands in for 40 years to prop up markets, and now it seems they are going to stop, at least for now.\n\nI hope this ~~ELI5~~ ~~ELI12~~ ELI-an-Intro-to-Econ student about why US gov bond rates are such an important concept for understanding global economics has been enlightening!",

Yes, Ethereum's price dumped during the bear market as well, but the OGs in the space and all of the developers kept their eyes laser focused on the development happening within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nI personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.\n\nUnless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to \"Cardano killing Ethereum\". Hint: they'll never migrate.\n\nI'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.\n\nTo all of the people about to yell at me for making another \"Cardano is overhyped post\" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about \"Ethereum killers\" and how \"great\" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?\n\nWhere is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same \"academic scientific approach\" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.\n\n!remindme 8 months\n\nEDIT: Maybe some users in the comment section can look at one another and realize that there is not a single rebuttal to my points (removed technical because one user is right, I didn't really provide \"technical\" arguments). Every post is about price action. Will Cardano potentially make you some money this bull run? Sure, that is, if you aren't stuck holding bags while everyone sells the top. But please, let's stay on topic. Present some counterarguments related to the actual utility of the network.\n\nEDIT 2: People should be aware that there was very similar hype surrounding Cardano leading up to the Coinbase [listing date](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778?gi=2495f7011d1c) (March 16-18), and the hype pump peaked at 1.38 (ATH at the time) on March 17, dumped to 1.24 (-10%) by March 18, and continued to dump to 1.06 (-25%) by March 24. Sure, it kept going up, and we may see a similar \"pump, dump, pump\" related to the smart contract release, but the \"pump\" following the \"dump\" all depends on execution and whether people actually care to use Cardano's platform.\n\nEDIT 3: Thanks to a great comment by u/BornToBeHwild, I learned that Cardano is already developing and supporting an Ethereum bridge ([https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/)), which proves my point entirely - Cardano won't \"kill everything in this space\", they are already building measures to integrate with the existing ecosystem and adapt, so maybe it's time to stop saying it will end all of the progress that has already been made in decentralized finance and media and take over the world.\n\nEDIT 4: I realize that my post is very triggering and I will edit the language a bit to emphasize the points I'm trying to make and remove some of the more triggering elements. Sometimes you forget in all of the mania that people have money at stake and I by no means am trying to \"FUD\" Cardano. I have friends and family who own this coin and I actually like Charles as he introduced me to a lot of the concepts I learned about in this space through his videos and lectures. I hope Cardano succeeds.\n\nThe point of my post was that people need to understand there already a ton of great, functioning products out there that all promised similar \"Ethereum killing\" capabilities that ultimately had to adapt and integrate with Ethereum in order to remain relevant and I do not think Cardano will be any different (see EDIT 3). Just trying to set expectations, especially for newcomers who are probably feeling FOMO for Cardano and are tempted to buy it while it's up x2 it's 2017 ATH and at the peak of its bull run. I'm not saying it won't go higher, but I do think the mania can be harmful for people who are just getting into the space now.\n\nEDIT 5: I want to bring attention to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vgije?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread made by u/Bwahehe, which is not getting enough upvotes and perfectly articulates the point I am getting across:\n\n>ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business.  \n>  \n>Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads.  \n>  \n>Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads.\n\nEDIT 6: I'm trying to respond to everyone but this is exploding... Also, I keep getting accused of \"missing\" Cardano or \"buying it high\" or something. Guys, look at my username. [I'm all about The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) (GRT).\n\nEDIT 7: I've been reading more and being a bit more selective about commenting back since there are just too many to keep up with and every time I refresh there's 50 more, but I'm really happy to see that the comments have shifted from price to actual discussion. Great to see! This is what r/CryptoCurrency should be all about! I like ADA, I like Charles, I want it to succeed for reasons I mentioned above.\n\nThis isn't meant to be a tribalistic war-igniting trigger post. I just think it's time to have real discussion on this sub and Cardano is the hottest topic because it is leading the bullrun in gains. Stop getting so bent out of shape, my post is not going to cause Cardano to dump, nor is it an attempt to provoke a dump. I think this is a great place for newcomers and old schoolers to join one another and discuss what they know. It's also a great opportunity for Cardano followers and supporters to counter my arguments and present their points and why they believe in the project - remember, I have not really kept up with Cardano since 2017, so I can totally be wrong about a lot of things and I accept that! The point is, this thread was a success because it reminded thousands of users here that we can still engage in high level discussions and not everything has to be about price and driving lambo rockets to the moon.\n\nJust want to thank a few posters for their great comments including  u/orangeblack07 ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vtoat?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/todayismycheatday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vsq6t/?context=3)), u/cali_dave ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vogw9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/OhIamNotADoctor ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vnxer?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). There are so many great comments, but as you can imagine, my inbox is absolutely obliterated and I need to go to sleep lol, so give these guys the upvotes they deserve!\n\nEDIT 8: Last edit (I hope). Some great discussion ultimately ensued and I appreciate everyone who made thoughtful posts. I definitely don't appreciate the attacks on my character and assumptions about who I am as a person, but I guess that's part of making controversial posts like this. Had no idea it would blow up so much and did my best to answer as many comments as I can. I really hope everyone knows that I do like ADA, I do like Charles, and I hope Cardano succeeds (though I think I've already mentioned this in another of my 45 edits). I was just hoping to stimulate some actual discussion on a subreddit that is in dire need of it. Thanks for engaging me. Till next time!\n\nEDIT 14: Lots of great comments actually made me realize I don't know the first thing about what is going on with Cardano at this point in time, I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's a lot more going on than I thought there was! I listed some of the good comments that pointed me in the right direction above in EDIT 6. Maybe I'm wrong about Cardano, maybe the slow and steady wins the race philosophy will prevail! Who knows. I'm just glad that there were so many newly introduced perspectives in this thread hidden between the shill and anti-graph\\_marine brigading. I'll be eagerly awaiting the launch of their smart contract platform and dApps so that I can dabble with them myself.\n\nThanks again to everyone who provided quality discussion and also to anyone who gave me awards, you really didn't have to do that!\n\ntl;dr (for those who want one) - Cardano has taken a very long time to release a product while others have thrived. People only seem to talk about Cardano during bull markets when the price is going up and I want to have a discussion about how people can think it is the end-all-be-all smart contract platform when it still doesn't have a working product. Discussion ensues. Some posters create great counter arguments and provoke thoughtful discussion while others brigade me with hateful spam.",

    "postText": "Indian government announces it will bring crypto under legal framework, taxable at 30% of gains. No capital losses or business expenses allowed Indian government just announced that crypto will be taxed at 30% of gains. This is the first time the Indian government is discussing crypto taxation. \nThe tax will apply to all gains on digital virtual assets, and no capital losses will be allowed. Business expenses will also not  be allowed.\n\nGifts in the form of digital currency will be also taxed in the hands of the receiver.\n\nThis is a landmark announcement as the first time the Indian government is announcing any law or regulation around crypto. So far nothing concrete was announced except rumors in the media. \n\nNow crypto being a taxable asset will lead to growth of adoption of crypto in India\n\n> I propose to provide that any income from transfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30%. No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be allowed while computing such income, except cost of acquisition: FM Nirmala Sitharaman\n\n\nEdit : Some sources are saying capital gains losses is not allowed only for offsetting it with other income sources. But it is still allowed within crypto. Waiting for more clarity on this.\n\nEdit 2: ~~It seems completely no capital losses.~~ https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/memo.pdf\n\nLaw mentions \"aggregate income from crypto transfers\" - some seem to think this means crypto losses can be offset among crypto itself. \n\n> However, no deduction in respect of any expenditure (other than cost of acquisition) or allowance or set off of any loss shall be allowed to the assessee under any provision of the Act while computing income from transfer of such asset\n\n> Further, no set off of any loss arising from transfer of virtual digital asset shall be allowed against any income computed under any other provision of the Act and such loss shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent assessment years.\n\n\nEdit 3: Most reaction seem to suggest 30% is really harsh. Especially when long term capital gains from stocks is like 10%. 30% will apply for developers and builders too, which will mean they will move to friendly tax jurisdictions rather than remain in India. Seems like a dumb and self defeating policy tbh.\n\nThe law taxes not profits but even transfers. So even simple actions like staking or moving funds or using a smart contract would become taxable. This is insane. Projects that originated in India like Polygon are already moving out, experts say most crypto companies will follow suit as a crypto native company doesn't want to deal with 30% tax for every transaction they make\n\nTaxation is at 30% of gains if you are investing. If you are earning 100% of your income through crypto (lots of Indian freelancers/developers are, the tax will be at 30% of total income, which is definitely harsh)\n\nEdit 4: CEX like WazirX and CoinDCX will now automatically report trades to the tax authorities as TDS. This is similar to other TDS tax deducted at source policies.  So if you are using them the gov will now automatically find out about your trades. \n\nWhile the tax provisions are definitely bad for Indian users, it creates clarity so now some rich guy with a few millions to spare who was interested in crypto, but waiting on the sidelines wondering if it will be totally prohibited or not can start investing as they know its not prohibited but taxed heavily. Could lead to more Indians getting in (i.e. Le india pamp)\n\n\n**TLDR: Govt is taxing all crypto transactions including simple transfers at a flat 30% tax. No capital losses or business expenses allowed. In the same day, govt reduced corporate taxes to lowest in Asia, and offered loan and debt waivers for corporates. Fuel prices are soaring. There is literally nothing in this budget if you are middle class common person. If you run a billion dollar company, well there are few sops in it. Someone earning their income through crypto will get shafted. Massively anti-poor/anti-middle class, pro-elites, pro those who fund this sham government headed by dictator Modi. Honestly, fuck this.. I hope they get routed in the upcoming elections but wont have high hopes as most of the country has been sucked into their hate fuelled religious brand politics**",

Its worth remembering that money is not everything. \n\nIf you have lost an obscene amount of unrealised gains, its best to make peace with it than to keep beating yourself up over it.\n\nEdit: LOL so many people embarrassing themselves and crying in comments.

I mean thousands of government policies have failed. \n\nHe isnt buying BTC to get rich over night. Its a long term policy decision for him. While you claim he is wasting tax payer money, he is actually putting his reputation on the chopping block here, which is more than anything you can claim.

You didnt care then when the past presidents over ran the country with gang violence? Oh yeah, you didnt even know the country existed. Now that they are trying something new with BTC, it suddenly hurts your feelings so much. \n\nEl Salvador have already started mining BTC from volcano energy that was being wasted, it represents a completely new income stream in a country that mainly depends only on tourism and remittances. Many reports already suggest the locals are able to save middle men fees by using BTC, while kicking out predators like Western Union. \nHe has kicked IMF out, American media will do everything to portray him in a bad light and all you will parrot what you read in the media. \nWhere were you guys when US Fed doubled the supply of USD in 1 year, printing relentlessly while other countries that depended on USD had no way to print any USD and had to bear the brunt of rampant inflation as they were hopelessly tied to USD? Of course, you never bothered to find out the reality of whats going on in other countries that used USD, while the Fed inflated it away. \nNow that he is trying something new to pivot away from BTC, and its not even been a year into a long term project, but you are ready to pass your judgements. \n\nJust a standard bunch of hypocrites.

The lowest it ever drop was on Feb 2018 about 64.9% and that took 1029 days to recover. The good news is that it will *likely recover again*.\n\n***edit***: A few comments below observed that the recovery phase seems to be getting faster so plotted this this as well.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[recover time](https://preview.redd.it/uraeqpwzgad81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=8998cce4073f2d0178fe89bee89534bd2dd598ef)\n\n&#x200B;",

    "postText": "I Resent This Sub For Bad Advice On CRO When I was new to crypto I was deciding which exchange to use and had decided on crypto.com. At the time crypto.com and their CRO coin had a bit of a bad reputation but I did my own research and determined that the things people were concerned about were growing pains and that an exchange with the domain crypto.com had a very bright future.\n\nAfter getting my account approved I posted here asking for advice on if I should invest a substantial amount in CRO since I believed crypto.com was destined to become a major player like binance and that inevitably the CRO price would go up.\n\nMy post was met with lots of fud and responses from people who had likely been burned or knew nothing about crypto.com and CRO. I should have gone with my gut and my own research however I was brand new to crypto and didn't trust myself.\n\nAt this time CRO was about $0.06. Now CRO is $0.50+ and crypto.com has bought the naming rights to the arena where the Lakers play.\n\nMoral of the story is 90% of what's posted here is garbage that won't help you make good investing decisions. Go with your gut.\n\nEDIT: Wow. I knew this sub had some bad advice but I didn't realize how incredibly toxic it had become as well. Everyone was new at some point. There are tons of new people coming here everyday to try and learn more about crypto.\n\nEDIT: One of the mods changed the flair of this post to comedy. That is completely unacceptable. Regardless of if they found my post to be funny it was clearly not intended to be a joke. I have changed it back and if it is changed again I will be reporting the situation to reddit.",

    "postText": "Yes, SHIB can go to a dollar It has come to my attention that some people think SHIB coins cannot reach a USD valuation of $1.00, but let me assure you that this is *simply not true!*\n\nA recent post explained that, for SHIB to reach $1.00, it would require a market cap of 558 *trillion* USD, about 500x the market cap of BTC. By comparison, as of 2021 the total wealth on earth is [431 trillion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/06/10/worlds-wealth-hits-half-a-quadrillion-dollars/?sh=2cf9123b309d) USD.\n\nHowever, a 558 trillion USD market cap does not require 558 trillion USD worth of purchases. A [recent study](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/revealed-how-much-money-it-takes-to-move-bitcoins-price-by-1) by Bank of America found that 100 million USD could move BTC's trillion-dollar market cap by 1% - therefore, only 10 billion USD (1% of BTC's current market cap) would be needed to double BTC's market cap.\n\nSHIB would only require 15 such doublings to reach a market cap over 500 trillion USD, requiring approximately 10 trillion USD in liquidity to do so. So, all we need is 10 trillion dollars - a perfectly reasonable amount of cash!\n\n**So the question is, how do we get 10 trillion dollars?**\n\nNo problem, let me introduce you to my friend, [1998-KU2](https://www.asterank.com/#152679). 1998-KU2 is a 4.7km-wide asteroid mainly comprised of [nickel, iron, and cobalt](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/03/aa32086-17/aa32086-17.html). 1998-KU2's component minerals have an estimated value of 80 trillion USD!\n\n[Here he is, circled in red.](https://preview.redd.it/yc2xy3tc21781.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=146247e2624d3e13e52e1ceeadb33e09430f7a0f)\n\nHowever, getting up there and mining those rare minerals won't be cheap - we'll need a rocket, mining equipment, a return vehicle, and some other seriously advanced technology. The estimated cost of all this is 70 trillion USD, leaving us with a healthy 10 trillion USD profit in cold, hard cash!\n\nSo all we need to do is go down to our local bank, get a small loan of 70 trillion dollars, build our rocket, swing by 1998-KU2, mine some minerals, return to Earth, sell the minerals for 80 trillion USD, repay our loan, place a SHIB buy order for 10 trillion USD, **and sit back and watch SHIB go to $1.00!**\n\nWho'd have thought that, to go to the moon, you'd need to go to the asteroid belt first?",

    "postText": "FINALLY got all my crypto off Robinhood. You should too. ASAP. I'll admit it: I've kept a large sum of my crypto on Robinhood this whole time... until now. To be fair, I had stopped actively buying with them a year ago, but had decided not to sell since they had announced they were developing crypto wallets. So I decided to just hodl until I could transfer out... and that time has finally come! Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. **As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!**\n\nScreenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS](https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS)\n\n**I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.** It's worth the gas price too ([which is a little lower than normal right now](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price)). If you've quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.\n\n*Why transfer out?* If you're not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I ([see more about that here](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/)). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having \"outages\" during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 ([check that out here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html)). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered \"technical difficulties\" during the epic Doge runup ([more info here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:~:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day)). So then, it's pretty clear that Robinhood's interests are NOT with you. **Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?**\n\nI'm not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:\n\n* [Robinhood CEO can\u2019t/won\u2019t answer questions](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lmyhur/for_those_still_on_the_fence_with_robinhood_watch/)\n* [Citadels CEO Lied Under Oath about a Collusion with Robinhood](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pw0kgt/leaked_documents_show_that_citadels_ceo_lied/)\n* [Robinhood locked the buy button when it suited them](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lfrslo/reminder_robinhood_blocked_several_stocks_from/)\n\nTLDR: I finally moved all my crypto off Robinhood now that they enabled my crypto wallet. You should too because they are shady AF.",

A quote from Satoshi Nakamoto:\n\nIt's the same situation as gold and gold mining.  The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold.  Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange.\n\nI think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.  The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used.  Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste.",

Those were the days!  The summer of 2017 was popping and thanks to my gains, I went from eating ramen straight out of the pack to using boiled water to soften the noodles.  Before my 2017 gains, my wife's boyfriend gained a lot of respect for me, and he even called me \"brah\" one day as he was picking up my wife for a hot date.  Man, I was on top of the world!\n\nFast forward to 2018, all my gains was gone.  Poof.  Overnight, I was back to eating ramen straight out of the pack.  I couldn't even afford the flavored ramen, just plain dry ramen with a generic label.  No brand names for me.  My wife's boyfriend went back to calling me Skid Mark instead of Regular Mark, and he never said \"brah\" to me ever again.  I was a loser.\n\nThe bear market was rough.  The crypto winter seemed like it would never end.  But I was diamond hands!  I hodled my coins and waited patiently.  Then, it happened!  The crypto winter was over and the bulls were back!  Life handed me a second chance!  My wife's boyfriend is back to calling me Regular Mark, and I think he's gonna call me \"brah\" again one day.  I can't believe how lucky I am!\n\nTo celebrate, I bought a pack of hot dogs and put hot dog slices in my ramen!  I still buy the non-flavored ramen cuz I want to save up and one day own a whole Satoshi.  But I believe in my dream!  And now my ramen tastes like boiled hot dog water, and I'm happier than I've ever been!\n\nJust remember, if you believe in yourself and you hodl, you can achieve anything!",

    "postText": "Kevin O'Leary just lied in front of the Senate - A felony offence. He said \"Binance intentionally put FTX out of business\" - total falsehood. SBF stole users deposits and paid Kevin O'Leary $15 M to act as his spokesperson Kevin O Leary just lied in front of the Senate, with the whole world watching.\n\nHere is his testimony under oath where he said this  to the question \"Why did FTX fail\": https://twitter.com/Benzinga/status/1603076399593844736\n\nLets get this straight - he said FTX didnt fail because of fraud, laundering user deposits into personal accounts or into their own hedge fund to make risky trades, bought expensive condos with customer deposits and just ran the most incompetent bucketshop ever possible etc, but because \"Binance put FTX out of business\"\n\nIn stark contrast, the main bankruptcy professional and new FTX  CEO John Ray told the House yesterday that FTX collapse was the result of old fashioned fraud. He was asked if Binance caused this, he flatly said NO. \n\nIn the testimony to House, he was asked by Rep Gonzalez (at time 2:43:30),\n\n> Rep Gonzalez: One of the things in Mr.  Bankman-fried's testimony that has  leaked, that wasn't submitted, is he spends time  talking about Binance and how Binance  created a run on the bank, suggesting that, had that not occurred, FTX was solvent and would have been just fine.  Prior to that episode -- is it your belief that FTX  was solvent? \n\n> Mr. John Ray: NO\n\n\nYou can listen to the testimony here and forward to the time mentioned above. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ObdFaUL7nc&t=9795s\n\nAlso this entire testimony of John Ray pretty much outlines how SBF was running a fraudulent shop for months. John who has now assumed control of FTX and is in an authoritative position to tell us what went wrong at FTX quite simply states the whole enterprise was a fraud. The DoJ, SEC and CFTC have already filed charges against SBF, but here we have Kevin O'Leary telling the Senate that SBF is innocent but its Binance put FTX out of business. \n\nWhats really dangerous is that Kevin knows this is not true, yet goes onto Senate to state lies under oath. He has worked his entire career in finance. He knows that John Ray has the best knowledge to put together what happened at FTX. He knows investigations of multiple agencies have put the blame on SBF. Yet he goes and tries to whitewash SBF's crimes. \n\nKevin O'Leary is a conman, who last week even said he would continue to do business with SBF. This week SBF got arrested, yet Kevin is still lying to the Senate. He got paid $15 M to be a shill for SBF. Its a shameful joke that he was even called up to testify in this issue. Its like inviting Ted Bundy's spokesperson to the Senate so that he can whitewash his crimes. Such actions dont make Ted Bundy or SBF look any better, but it just diminishes the respect of the Senate as an institution. \n\nThis guy deserves to be in the same cell as SBF. Every penny paid by SBF to this fraudster must be clawed back to make FTX depositors whole.",

    "postText": "Doge may be a memecoin, but it brought me to this community and made me invest in other crypto. Back in february when the whole GME hype started, I saw a couple threads popping up that the Dogecoin comminity is planning to rise as well. It was too late for me to invest in GME as it already spiked, so I tried my luck with Doge and bought at 0.05\u20ac for 50\u20ac. Not to be too risky with my first investment ever... 2 months later I cashed out (a bit too early) and made about 180\u20ac. So my total wallet was now \u20ac230, which I planned to invest in Doge again once the price dropped. \n\nLuckily the price stayed up and I realized that if I'd put my money back in Doge, I would only lose. Either the price stays up and I end up with less doge than I initially had or I buy when the price drops and end up with less \u20ac if it continues to drop. \n\nSo I started looking for alternatives to invest my winnings. I searched for other \"cheap\" coins, that had a lot of potential to grow, by reading this subreddit and came across VET and ADA.  I gained some confidence by profiting from the doge investment and deposited another \u20ac500 into my wallet. I put \u20ac300 into VET and 350\u20ac into ADA. I might put the remaining \u20ac80 back into Doge. It's an unpredictable meme after all, so who knows what happens. \n\nI'm planning to create a more diverse portfolio if my current investment works somewhat out. Doge might not be the most popular among the altcoins  in this sub, but it was a great starting point for me and made me interested in other crypto currencies.  I also want to thank this community for being insightful, helpful and welcoming to crypto newbies.",

For me, this remains a cautionary tale that not only can you lose your coin but also your private information.

It's my first coin. It was perfect: Instant. Feeless. Green. IMO, it was what Satoshi intended as the ultimate crypto**currency**.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I understand Nano came to be in a situation where smart contracts where not such a big thing, and there were no \"swaps\" and there was no staking/lending/liquidity pools etc. People want more from crypto and that's OK. But I'm not OK with freakin' SHIB and SAFEMOON having a larger mcap than Nano. I'll never be OK with that. For the love of all that is holy, SAFEMOON should not be a word any of us remember in two years. \n\nSure, there were two major incidents, both occurring in the bull runs, the exchange exit scam crap and the spam attacks now.  And sure, it was shilled here relentlessly. And people hate shillers. But how can a coins main fault be \"it's fan base is annoying\"?? \n\n/my incoherent rant, I'm just bummed something so technically great is not actually \"appreciated\" more.\n\n\n\n**Edit**: holy amount of comments, Batman.  RIP my inbox.\n\nThank you everyone for the awards, there's too many of them to reply to you all individually (i still believe in thanking personally for the awards but since my inbox is MIA, this is a bit troublesome).\n\nAlso, someone was so concerned about me being bummed, a bot sent me a message about suicide hotline. While I would never do something like that over crypto (or money), I honestly appreciate the kind thought. You are (as Keanu says) breathtaking.\n\n\n\nTake care everyone (even Safemoon holders).\n\n**Edit 2** this has become my most upvoted post. I don't know what to say. Thank you to everyone, Nano fans and Nano haters.\n\nAlso, it seems Safemoon holders have figured out this post, so they started brigadding. Some had hilarious things to say about Nano (e.g. \"Out of #100 instant and feeless\" and \"Nano is very fast. Out of top 100hehe\"). Laughs were had. Just to clarify, if Safemoon and SHIB start doing great things, there will be no one happier than me. I still think both of them have too many red flags, but I'm happy for you if you profit.

And while you might be tempted to take your coins off an exchange, think about the amount you will spend for fees. For example the average fees for moving out ETH is 0.02 ETH (~$35) sometimes this is the amount most people have. Similar example can be applied to other coins as well. \n\nAnother point is that exchanges are not un-secure anymore. They will store coins with high security measures. And you should enable things like 2FA to keep your account even more secure. So don\u2019t worry about your coins being in danger.\n\nIf someone has any other suggestions please let us know.\n\nEdit: Tips from comments:\n\n1. From u/ACShreds - Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month so if you do want to withdraw coins, try buying from that platform although the fees are a little high compared to other platforms.\n\n2. From u/thegooddocgonzo - Although exchanges aren\u2019t fully safe, many big and reputable one like Coinbase and Binance will do everything to keep your coins safe because they don\u2019t want any bad reputation. The user also notes that Binance was hacked in 2019 and Binance made sure that no customer was impacted. Stay cautious of smaller and unknown exchanges.\n\nEdit 2: The withdrawal fee which I stated for ETH (0.02) was for the exchange I primarily use which is WazirX. I\u2019m sorry for not mentioning the said exchange and for those asking where I got that figure here is your answer.",

This sub has some of the worst investing advice I've ever seen and is full of people who essentially won a billion dollars in the lottery, so now they think that makes them Warren Buffet. Let me preface this by saying that if you put 1000$ into bitcoin back when it was first released, you are probably very rich today. But let's not let that distract from the fact that it makes you somebody who wired 1000$ to an anonymous person on the internet, in exchange for some magic beans. \n\nThese days you're probably stupid not to have money invested in crypto, but just keep in mind that it's almost entirely based on speculation, and a lot of your success is based on pure luck. **Everybody is a genius investor in a bull market**. The people you see posting here acting like seasoned investing gurus, are more often than not people who just happened to get lucky a few times. Have fun with your Baron Rothschild memes, acting like every person who invests in crypto is going to become a millionaire. \n\nThis is not the first time in history when a generation of young people have jumped on a wild speculation train and gotten rich. During the height of the dotcom bubble, people had the exact same attitudes. \"25% returns in a year? Those are scrub numbers. Anything less than 100% is unacceptable!\" We all know how that ride ended, and this ride shall too come to an end. Whether it ends in a major bust, or it becomes a mainstream financial tool dominated by Wall Street, this ride will come to an end. Enjoy the great returns while you can.\n\n",

    "postText": "If you support crypto, please read. I know many of us disagree on many things. We all have our favorite pet projects and argue about everything from proof of work versus proof of stake, to store of value versus medium of exchange. Some of us are into defi, for others its NFTs; maybe it's meme tokens that float your boat, or just plain old electronic cash.\n\nBut I like to believe we also all share something in common. We believe in the power of crypto. We believe in what it represents and what it can one day make possible. But it's not just going to happen on its own. The future isn't going to be handed to us on a silver platter and it's going to take as many of us as possible to fight the powers that be and make our voices heard.\n\nI'm not proposing we take down the fed tomorrow, but what I am talking about is something much smaller, something I'm hoping you can help me set right.\n\nThe other day I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyb6zt/an_open_letter_to_johnny_lyu_and_kucoin_exchange/) about the exchange Kucoin. I explained how they've been holding \\~$50K of my BCHA (aka XEC on every other exchange) for over six months without letting me withdraw. I shared emails showing how they've given me nothing but the runaround since May, and how Kucoin themselves had [announced](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-kucoin-will-support-bcha-upgrade-0820) their support of this project 3 months ago, causing me and others to buy even more.\n\n[People's exchange my ass.](https://preview.redd.it/qwcsz21p09181.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=85286d659c2edec9267f65c9b0496e13e328e285)\n\nBut they've failed to live up to their word.\n\nWhile I was thankful to see so many kind and supportive comments, giving me hope for the crypto community at large, I'm sorry to say Kucoin still has yet to tell me when I'll be able to withdraw my coins.\n\nTo those who suggested I just sell my BCHA and withdraw in USDT, the fact is I can't because there is no liquidity left. Who wants to buy a coin on an exchange if you can't withdraw, and I hold enough coins that I would have to sell for cents on the dollar if I did. Not to mention I'd just be passing off the problem to some other poor soul.\n\nBut what's most important is that I shouldn't have to do any of that. And giving up would just be letting Kucoin off the hook, which I'm not about to do.\n\nSo I'm asking for help from the wider cryptocurrency community. I want to believe that people in this community, more than any other, understand the difference between right and wrong and believe in a sense of justice in this world.\n\nI'm asking you to help me right this wrong, and share this post with as many people as possible. My goal is to reach the top of this subreddit and send a loud message to u/Johnny_Kucoin (Johnny Lyu, CEO of Kucoin) that his exchange can't get away with this.\n\nAt this point I know that \\~$50K of my money is probably gone, but I want everyone in crypto to hear about this so they understand the type of exchange Kucoin is. Because if they can steal my money, there's nothing stopping them from doing the same to you.\n\nI for one am tired of industry players who give crypto a bad name. It's time to call out bad actors and send a message to these companies that they must treat their customers right or we'll simply move our business elsewhere.\n\nI know this is a longshot, but I'm asking you to spread the word, because I am confident that this space is full of amazing people who believe in supporting each other and holding bad actors accountable.\n\nI'm not a vindictive person. I don't want Kucoin to go out of business. I just want them to do the right thing and make sure others aren't cheated out of their money like I was.\n\nThank you for reading and best of luck to everyone.",

Anyway the website is now deleted so you can't see anything.*\n\n I own a telegram group where this morning an user entered telling everyone to be quick because today it was starting the private sale of a new coin.\n\nI looked at its website and it was clearly made by an amateur. It's whitepaper was a joke.\n\nHowever, the devs officially doxxed themselves and most users in their \"official\" telegram group were starting to believe in this scam.\n\nI noticed some users were clearly fake, saying things like \"I follow this project since 1 year and it's amazing\" but I checked and the **group was created just few days ago so how they were following this project since 1 year ago?**\n\nI then decided to **contact on LinkedIn the 2 official admins of the project**. They both answered me that they had nothing to do with it and clearly someone took their names and photos and posted them on that website.\n\n45 minutes were remaining before the private sale would start. By the way, the private sale was going to work in this way: they would publish a bsc address and everyone had to send bnb at that address. In exchange they would receive back 2000 of these new tokens.\n\nI posted in their group that admins were liars and that the people listed in the official website were not related to this project in any way.\n\nThey accused me of fud, I had no proofs. Also they were deleting most of my messages. \n\n**Then I tried what I thought was impossible, because only the worst amateur would make such a mistake: I did a whois of the domain of their website** and found out the website was created just 2 days ago, and I found the name and the address of the owner. This guy didn't even think to hide it properly.\n\n**At this point it was just few minutes before the official launch of the private sale. I simply posted in the group the name and the home address of the scammer and then \"if anyone will be scammed, just give this name to the police\"**\n\nAdmins abandoned the group immediately, countdown went to 0 but no private sale started. They literally disappeared and they had no opportunity to scam anyone.\n\nObviously they were amateurs, it's harder with professional scammers, but I'm proud that I destroyed the plan of these scammers who invested money and time in creating their website and preparing this scam.",

    "postText": "In December NFL offensive tackle, Russell Okung, asked for half of his salary in BTC. That half is now worth more than his entire salary. Okung asked for half of his $13 million contract for 2020 to be paid in Bitcoin, and the Carolina Panthers were able to make it happen. Here\u2019s some quotes from the article. Sauce at the bottom. \n\n\u201cIf we are looking at where Bitcoin is at now, Okung could be considered one of the highest salaried NFL players at this moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, when BTC hit $44k, the half of his contract that is paid in BTC climbed to $10.59 million, at $56k+ his half turned into more than his entire quoted salary. As far as 2020 NFL salary stats are concerned, Okung has entered the top five position. However, the NFL has recently decided to cap the league\u2019s salaries at $180 million and a ball player\u2019s contract could change in 2021. Because the Carolina Panthers\u2019 offensive tackle (OT) gets half of his salary in BTC, many proponents think of him as the highest-paid player in the NFL and not just ahead of the highest-paid OTs.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney is more than currency; it\u2019s power,\u201d said Okung in a statement. \u201cThe way money is handled from creation to dissemination is part of that power. Getting paid in bitcoin is the first step of opting out of the corrupt, manipulated economy we all inhabit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkung went further into that statement adding: \u2018When we are all paid in bitcoin, no one can tell us what to do with the value we create \u2026 In a post-fiat world, you won\u2019t have to worry about your labor and time being stolen.\u201d \n\n[Sauce](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/seahawks/former-seattle-seahawk-russell-okung-puts-half-salary-bitcoin-considered-highest)\n\nNow that the NBA has a NFT and a blockchain advisory committee, I wanted to remind everyone that this happened.

I'm legitimately blown away how many people I see defending the banks/credit companies banning crypto purchases as some type of attempt to protect their customers from a volatile market. Credit is predatory by nature. The bank doesn't care when you max your card out on alcohol, designer clothes, gambling, or any other worthless and risky commodity. Your bank doesn't give one single tiny little shit about you in any way beyond your capacity to generate revenue. You are a revenue generating unit and nothing more, end of story. They are building artificial barriers to crypto because they view it as a direct and fundamental threat to their industries... and with good reason, because it is. The reality is anyone who invests wisely in crypto right now is going to make a significant ROI over the next few years, opening up the opportunity to pay off large balances, which decreases the revenue they earn from interest. This is nothing more than a desperate attempt at self preservation. \n\nAgain I would encourage anyone who has their bank or credit card company create a barrier for them to purchase crypto, to immediately end doing business with that institution and make sure they know why. If my bank halts my purchases, I'll liquidate my account and close it the same day. Same goes with my credit cards, they will get cut up and never used again.

Return on investments are not expressed by months, weeks or days. They are expressed *annually*.\n\nSo when you say, \"*You can get 2% of APY/month*\", or \"*with a 1% interest/week*\", or \"i*f you coumpound interest on a 10% APY*\", then you sound like a fool.\n\nThere are two different acronym you *need* to understand.\n\n**APR** : Annual percentage rate; it's the annual rate of return on an investment, **without any compounding**.\n\nIt's basically the return you realise by lending (or staking, etc.) an asset after a year, if you do not touch it (no compounding). So, if you invest $100'000 with a 10% APR, you will get a return $10'000 after a year (10%).\n\n**APY** : Annual percentage yield ; it's rate of return earned on an investment, **taking into account the effect of compounding interest**.\n\nIt's the return you realise when compounding the interest whenever it's possible to do it. The compounding can take place daily, weekly, monthly, annually. It depends on the terms & conditions of your investment.\n\n**Compound interest**: it's the fact the interest accrued on your investment is (automatically/manually) added to your investment and start accruing interest as well.\n\nAn APR where you can compound interest daily is going to be a much higher APY than an APR with monthly coumpounding.\n\nLet's take a few examples:\n\n* 12% APR. That's 12% per year (or 1% per month if you want). So if you invest $100, you get 12$ a year (1$ every month). After a year, you have $112.\n* 12% APR allowing you to monthly compound. That's a 12.68% APY. So if you invest $100, you get 1$ the first month (that you coumpound), $1.01 the next month, $1.021 the third, $1.0303 the fourth, and so on.\n* 18% APY with a daily compound, is a 16.56% APR.\n* 45% APY with monthly compound, is a 37.18% APR.\n\nIf you want to understand how to convert your APR to your APY, you can head there: [www.aprtoapy.com](http://www.aprtoapy.com). There are also the mathematical formulas and explanations.\n\nI hope that helps some of you to better understand the financial aspects your investments and use the correct terminology, so you don't look and/or sound uneducated.\n\nHave a great day!",

Even if they aren't, that doesn't mean it's a good investment.\n\nThe value and room for growth of any Cryptocurrency is determined by it's Marketcap. The market cap of a token is calculated by multiplying the value of one coin into the total supply of the coin.\n\nIf a coin has the value of $0.0001 a piece and the market cap of $100 billion and you buy a million tokens thinking it'll make you a millionaire someday, you are WRONG!\nThis token will NEVER go to $1. For it to reach $1 the market cap of the crypto would have to be $1 Quadrillion Which is IMPOSSIBLE! Even Bitcoin, the OG, doesn't have that marketcap. \n\nThat being said, while checking the marketcap is important,if the token is deflationary you should check the minimum supply it will have in the future and then calculate it's highest possible growth.\n\nIf there is something I need to add or correct, please comment it.\n\nEdit: Market capitalisation is obviously not the only criteria which can help us determine how much a coin's value can grow, but it is a good place to start. There are plenty other things such as total supply and max supply of tokens, fully diluted market cap, volume etc. \nOne should always read the token's whitepaper to find all the details, check social media handles of the dev team and the official handle of the token (if they have any).",

Today May 22, 2022 crypto lovers are celebrating Bitcoin pizza day.  Our 12th anniversary.\n\nPreviously cryptos were not accepted as a payment method, but after a man from Florida bought a meal using Bitcoin, that was all people could talk about.\n\nOn 22 May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer and BTC miner from Florida, used the crypto to purchase two pizzas from Papa John\u2019s. **It is the first physical item purchased with the first decentralized digital currency.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/deaz05tzvu091.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e537cbd4ec411462bb1a2fb6bdda423a0709293\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aohtm4qjxu091.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=c447e279f194415e477963ba08d2e05b7e2dbb37\n\n**Laszlo Hanyecz who spent cryptocurrency (10,000 BTC) now worth over 295,000,000.00 USD on 2 pizzas said he has no regrets.**\n\nAfter the first transaction, Hanyecz would go on to do it many more times and spend a total of 100,000 Bitcoin on pizza that summer - now worth $2,9billion.\n\nTHE NUMBERS ARE GROWING AND SO IS CRYPTO, more than 15,000 establishments worldwide already accept cryptocurrency as payment.\n\n**To commemorate Lazlo's legendary transaction, May 22 is dubbed\u00a0Bitcoin Pizza Day.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93a1im5txu091.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=7278db2b0826d6476d05f28fde39d22a2df0c8e2",

    "postText": "Congratulations Lunatics. Do Kwon just gave regulators the opportunity they have been gagging for to come in and absolutely rail the crypto industry and exchanges. First off, the collapse of Luna caught the attention of regulators around the globe, especially in the USA. Stable coin regulation is coming and there is nothing anyone can do about it. I don\u2019t actually think this is a bad thing to prevent future meltdowns (full audit of tether pls).\n\nSo what does this c#ck head do\u2026\u2026.creates Luna 2.0. This is a regulators wet dream. The optics on this whole thing are so incredibly bad.\n\nTo ALL of the exchanges out there who listed this token\u2026\u2026you fucked up. \n\nNot only do the regulators have hard on for flogs like Do Kwon, but you are in their crosshairs even more now. Exchanges literally listed the exit pump token for Do Kwon\u2019s initial ponzi. Utterly psychotic. Like how can they be so stupid.\n\nExchanges should have denied the listing of Luna 2.0. \n\nThis is why we are so far away from full scale adoption. It\u2019s bullshit like this and maybe it\u2019s time for the regs to come in and clean this bullshit up.

    "postText": "Why are so many of you people \"HODLing nomatter what\"? I cannot understand the \"any selling is weak hands\" argument.  Why not spend a little more time paying attention to the economy in the short-term, so you can make proactive decisions about your investments? \n\nHere's a bit of reality for all you genius apes.  \n\nThe fed meeting is tomorrow and its going to be a .75 basis point hike.  First time since 1994.  Some of this is already baked into markets (I'm assuming you've realized by now that your stocks are down almost 10% and crypto is down 30% since Friday), but there is always more room to drop and more pain to come. \n\nA lot more.  \n\nWhen JP pulls a switcheroo from .5 to .75 a mere 36 hours before the Fed meeting, you had better bed your ass that he'll open up the doors for more hikes at .75.  And he should.  A CPI at 8.6 is bonkers with a base funds rate of 1.5%.  It's borderline economic catastrophe.  Since the invention of the dollar, rate hikes have only successfully brought down inflation once they got within 2.5% of the inflation rate.  Get your calculator out bc that means if the inflation rate were to stay at 8.7 (yea right) it would take 6 more rate hikes to get us in the functional range. When he says that \"we are now considering .75 rate hikes in July and September, possibly higher\" you had better believe people are going to trade whatever they can for cold hard cash.  \n\nAnd that's not all.  \n\nYou've probably heard of Quantitative \"Easing\".  That's how the Fed \"prints\" money into existence. They create the money on a magic computer and use it to purchase treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (those bundles of mortgages you heard Christian Bale and Steve Carrell talking so much about in The Big Short).  The Fed bought 3 boatloads of this stuff in 2008 (these purchases are referred to as the \"bailouts\"), and up to now they've got about $8,500,000,000,000 worth.  That's trillion, with a T. \n\nNow we get to play a new game.  Quantitative \"Tightening\".  \n\nStarting tomorrow (Wednesday for anyone late to the party), the Fed will sell $45,000,000,000 in assets onto the open market.  That's going to be a whole lot of pressure on markets to stay up and we all know people aren't exactly buying-hand-over-fist right now.  Their purpose is to bring markets down.  That, by definition, is fighting inflation.  Remember: price up = bad.  Price down = good.  \n\nBut the QT fun doesn't end there.  The Fed is going to sell another $45 billion in assets in July, and another $45B in August.  Then, they will increase the rate to $95 BILLION EVERY MONTH starting in September.  At that rate of monthly selling they won't run out of MBS for 7.5  years.  \n\nLet's talk about those mortgage-backed securities for a second. Those bundles of thousands of mortgages we call MBS start out when you buy a house. Or when your cousin buys a condo to rent on Airbnb.  Remember when you finally closed on your house and 2 days later you received a letter saying that your loan was purchased by another lender?  \"Underwriting\" is your lender making sure there is a buyer ready and willing to buy this loan the moment you close on the property.  That's why you get the notice right away.  As you were figuring out to whom you should make your mortgage payment that new lender was bundling your loan with many others to sell yet again to a bigger bank.  The bundle grows each time and at some point they refer to them as MBS, and for some reason they are considered much more secure than individual mortgages.  They are given ratings like A, BB, CCC, etc.  Picture Ryan Gosling playing jenga.  Now when the biggest MBS customer not only stops buying but starts dumping MBS onto the market, you can imagine the demand for these bundles of joy will shift.  Soon smaller banks can't sell to bigger banks as easily as before. And eventually not at all.  This past Friday the market for MBS actually hit \"zero bids\" for the first time since 2008 (you might have seen a tweet from the actual Michael Burry).  As loans become harder to sell, will also become harder to write.  And we know what that will do to the housing market.  Remember: price down = good.  \n\nNow you're getting it.  \n\nLastly, because my legs are asleep, you need to understand that most of the money that came into crypto since 2017 was not from people here on reddit.  Many of them do not share your diamond hands conviction, and their crypto investment doesn't represent an \"inflation hedge\".  It represents the riskiest thing they've ever done with their money.  Ever. Big risk = big reward.  And when both the stock market and the housing market get tumultuous, risk assest get sold first.  That is what you are starting to see. An almost perfect correlation between crypto and the Nasdaq, just where the swings in crypto gains and losses are exaggerated. \n\nUnfortunately we are probably one or two cycles away from certain cryptos being seen and used like the scarce resource inflation hedge that they really are.  \n\nSo here you are, with all this new knowledge and a bag of Shitcoin Potpourri.  And there is a train coming tomorrow that will last until at least through September.  \n\nGood luck!",

So I like many of you have found my self looking less and less at the charts and trying to occupy myself with other things like work and sleep, both of those things get old pretty fast so I asked myself \"What If I made my own Shit Coin??\"\n\nThe process is fairly easy and will cost you surprisingly little, the entire process cost me only 15 ALGOs and I could still withdraw most of that out of the wallet I created for this project. I decided to use Algorand for this due to it's ease of use and low fees.\n\n# Step one: The Wallet\n\nCreate a Pera Wallet and transfer around 15 ALGO into it. (around $5.00 USD)\n\nPera wallet is available on Android and IOS, you can also use any other ALGO wallet you prefer.\n\n# Step Two: Creating the Algorand Standard Asset\n\nHead on over to [algodesk.io](https://algodesk.io) and connect said wallet.\n\nclick on the top right button labeled **create asset,** you will get the following box pop up. fill in the required information and confirm the transaction on you wallet. (this fee I believe is around 1 ALGO)\n\n^(For this example I decided to create the shittiest shit coin I could think of so its called ButtCoinASA in honor of) r/Buttcoin\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08a2w3mpgw191.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ca17782da4c0bc41ef1e7f3f51a8b7c7f5d3283\n\n# Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of your very own ALGO ASA\n\n# Step Three: Providing Liquidity\n\nSo now you have this new asset in your wallet but its not really known to the world, what to do?\n\nVisit Algorands best DEX called [tinyman.org](https://tinyman.org) then follow the steps below.\n\n* connect wallet\n* click on the tab labeled **pool**\n* click create pair\n* select Algo and (your new ASA), you'll have to search for it and click on the box labeled ^(\"hide unverified assets\")\n* &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8seesx5jw191.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc79bdbee1136fccac25bae73ab6a4836c73b5ec\n\n* now add as much ALGO and your ASA as you want (this will give it your initial value, if you add 1 ALGO and one ButtCoin then 1 ALGO = 1 Butt)\n* Congrats, your ShitCoin now has some value\n* wait about thirty minutes and then head on over to [tinychart.org](https://tinychart.org)\n* &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtfprjtvjw191.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb7c84a5705bb8362f47036c486d855fe3109d08\n\n* and look, your ShitCoin is now listed and shows a value.\n\n# Step Four: Be A Millionaire\n\nthat's it\n\nYour done.\n\nYou are now a Millionaire \\*^(on paper)\n\nSo I created ButtCoinASA and I hold all one billion of them so if you multiply 1,000,000,000 x $0.0019 + 1.9 million dollars!!!!!\n\nsure I cant cash it out because it only has $3.00 worth of liquidity but it does look like green on that chart to me so I'll take it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it boys and girls, you are now the owner of your very own bonafied Shit Coin.\n\nWhat can you do with it? well what ever you'd like to\n\n* share it with friends\n* give it to strangers\n* start some sort of reward system for your kids\n* if your competent maybe even turn it into an actual project with some real uses and make some money\n* the sky is the limit\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Edit: This is a shitcoin and I'm giving it away by the thousands, please do not provide liquidity I don't want to be responsible for people losing their money.",

    "postText": "A collection of all the possible ways to earn free Crypto The following list contains every possible way I know to earn some actual, free cryptocurrencies. I avoided shady websites, apps that I didn't try personally, and those services that make you download shitty games and malwares. This list contains only trusted services, without any referral codes.\n\nIf you think I missed something, please share it in the comments so that people can check that out as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coinbase Earn** **\\[about $30 in different cryptocurrencies\\]:**\n\nThis is one of the most popular ways, although it is not really the quickest. You need a Coinbase account and to complete verification (so photo + document). Once you are verified, you will be put on a waiting list that usually lasts a couple of days. \n\nOnce you get accepted, all you have to do is watch a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it. It is not anything hard and you can find the answers online.\n\nRight now, you can earn XLM, COMP, CGLD, GRT, NU, but they often update it with a new project so definitely keep the account once verified.\n\n[LINK](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CoinMarketCap Earn** **\\[various cryptocurrencies\\]:**\n\nBasically the same as Coinbase Earn, but hosted by CoinMarketCap. For this, you'll need a CoinMarketCap account (just needs e-mail and password) and a verified Binance account (which requires verification, but there's no waiting list once verified). \n\nThe payouts are slower than Coinbase Earn, since they are distributed after weeks and not immediately.\n\n[LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Faucets \\[various cryptocurrencies\\]:**\n\nThis is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get a small amount of crypto. You just need a wallet that can hold the coin and the relative address, and you're good to go.\n\nThey're basically websites that distribute small amounts of cryptos to the users asking for it, and they're supported by donations/ads and stuff like that.\n\nThere are a lot and you can often find them just by searching on Google \"<name of the coin> + faucet\".\n\nA [good read](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-faucet) about them and some examples: [freenanofaucet](https://www.freenanofaucet.com/) and [Doge Faucet](https://www.dogefaucet.com/en)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Airdrops \\[various cryptocurrencies\\]:**\n\nAn airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. \n\nThey can be free or they might require holding certain tokens or doing small tasks.\n\nAirdrops happen on many different platforms and for many different coins, so it's often hard to find them if you aren't familiar with the community or the platform. Anyway, [Airdrops.io](https://Airdrops.io) is a good website that gathers the best airdrops happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bounties \\[various cryptocurrencies\\]:**\n\nIn the crypto world, it is a marketing strategy where an ICO allocates a percentage of their tokens for \u201cbounties\u201d. These are tasks that are open to the public to complete and their reward is the new token that is launching. Once the token is launched, participants of the bounty will receive their tokens. \n\nAs you may have noticed, they're similar to airdrops. As airdrops, it is often difficult to find them. [This](https://beta.bounty0x.io/explore) is a good website that gathers some bounties that are currently active.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WeNano \\[NANO\\]:**\n\nThis is one of my favorites, so I encourage you to check them out since the project is awesome.\n\nHave you ever played Pok\u00e9mon Go? Well, this is a similar app, but instead of capturing Pok\u00e9mon, spots are created by users around the world, and by visiting them you can earn NANO and chat with other users. The payouts are actually really good, especially in large cities, and the community around it is awesome.\n\n[This](https://www.wenano.net/) is the official website (it's available both for Android and iOS)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NanoQuakeJs \\[NANO\\]:**\n\nAnother favorite of mine. It's literally just Quake 3, on your browser, and for each kill you get some NANO. I challenge you to find something cooler.\n\n[This](https://nanoquakejs.com/) is the website, you just need a nickname and a NANO address and you're good to go!\n\nThere are some other similar projects, one of which is [PlayerKillers](http://playerkillers.exchange/), but I mean, Quake is Quake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reddit \\[MOON, DOGE, NANO\\]:**\n\nYeah, Reddit. There are actually a couple of ways to earn crypto on Reddit.\n\nFirst, our favorite, MOONs. You just need to set up your vault (on the app) and you're ready to receive moons next distribution! They happen once a month, and a fixed amount of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community, based on the Karma you gained that month. So start shitposting!\n\nOther subreddits, like Dogecoin's and Nano's have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there you'll probably receive some coins from kind redditors. \n\nAlso, subs like r/dogecoinbeg exist, where you can... Well... Beg for dogecoins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Publish0x \\[ETH\\]:**\n\nThis is a really cool project that I personally love. It is basically a website like Medium, where users can post blog entries.\n\nThe best thing about this is that the website provides the coins. You will literally earn crypto just by reading content on the website (which is crypto-related), sharing content and writing it (although you'll need to apply as an author to do so).\n\n[LINK](https://www.publish0x.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SteemIt \\[STEEM\\]:**\n\nSteemit is a blogging and social media platform that uses blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency to reward its users for creating content, commenting, and upvoting other posts.\u00a0 \n\nIt is really similar to Reddit, [here](https://steemit.com/)'s the link\n\n[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~discover/) is another similar social network built on top of Ethereum, worth checking out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NFT marketplaces \\[various cryptocurrencies\\]:**\n\nMany websites offer the possibility to sell artworks, collectibles and in general NFTs. NFT, for the newcomers, stands for Non-Fungible Token, and means a token representing something unique. \n\nYou can think of it as an art piece: although you can copy it, scan it and print it, there will only be one original copy. NFTs are used to verify and confirm the uniqueness of something and its ownership. So, let's say I make a beautiful digital painting, I can \"link\" it to this token and whoever owns the token, owns the digital painting and can therefore sell it or trade it.\n\n[KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) are all great example of such marketplaces. If you're a creative person and want to sell some of your works, those are great places to do so. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Games and Collectibles \\[various cryptocurrencies\\]:**\n\nMany games run on a blockchain, using NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets. Think of a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, it is possible to create only 10 cards of a specific type (using NFTs), so only 10 users in the world can own that card, so that card would extremely rare and therefore valuable.\n\nUsually, it is not easy to earn crypto this way, you'll need to play a bit before getting some good stuff that you can sell, but if you find a game that you like you can surely earn while having fun!\n\nExamples of games are [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/home), [EverDragons](https://everdragons.com/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Brave Frontier Heroes](https://bravefrontierheroes.com/).\n\nSome aren't even games at all, just collectibles that you can buy, trade and earn. Examples are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/catalogue) and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEndnote: especially services using NFTs on top of Ethereum are, right now, subject to really high fees that make it often impossible to trade these tokens effectively. Be careful when doing a transaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\nSome I forgot or didn't know about:\n\n* **Brave browser**: allows you to earn BAT just by browsing and seeing ads. Both on PC and mobile.\n* **ethtrader and fortniteBR**: they're also subreddits with a governance tokens (like moons), so you can earn some money shitposting there too.",

    "postText": "If crypto has stopped you caring about other elements of your life, you need to urgently reconsider things... I get it.\n\nWhen you're in the middle of a bull market and prices continue to rise, it's easy to think that other, more traditional methods of income are a waste of time. Your salary suddenly seems inconsequential and other investments are boring as hell.\n\nWe often talk about not putting all your money into crypto, but there's another element to this too - you shouldn't dedicate all your mental energy to crypto either.\n\nWhen the next bear market comes, and it will come at some point, having nothing in your life except crypto and your portfolio app is going to make for a very depressing period.\n\nEven if you're making paper profits of 10k a day, you still need to develop other areas of your life - whether that's career, relationships, new business ventures etc - because everyone needs something to fall back on, both financially AND mentally.\n\nI run a small SaaS platform in my spare time, and it generates very little money in the grand scheme of things. But it's mine and I enjoy developing it and getting new customers. If the crypto market was to tank tomorrow, I'd still have this, and that would mean a lot to me. \n\nEqually, I also have my normal job, and whilst it can be a bit dull at times (and in recent months almost a bit pointless!) it is still something I have continued to strive at, and it's another form of personal development that can open future financial doors.\n\nThis is essentially a post about eggs and baskets, but just wanted to point out that the metaphor is more than just financial - it's also about your wider mindset and not letting other areas of your life slide.",

And coins like SHIB, LRC, KDA, and SOL are never mentioned until after they explode. \n\nThis is entirely by design. Your exposure to posts on reddit is a function of how many upvotes those posts have received. And the more bagholders a particular coin has, the more upvotes. Which is why the front page is a billboard for ADA, ETH, ALGO, VET, and a handful of others. By definition, the coins you repeatedly see here already have large numbers of holders. You don't get rich buying something that everyone else already owns. Hence why projects start to stagnate when they become popular. Popularity on r/cryptocurrency is actually a great indicator for when growth can be expected to taper. Cardano is perhaps a prime example. \n\nBy contrast, posts about undiscovered projects will almost universally be buried. There may well have been a post shilling SOL at $1 or SHIB in 2020, but they never would have made it past the last page.",

Two years ago from today on March 13th the big Covid-19 black swan happened. Stock market and Crypto saw massive sharp unexpected dips. All that happened for Crypto during a bear market period after the 2018 parabolic top. That was the time where BTC and Crypto were called \"officially death\" even by its own investors as this was very unexpected and many did not have any hope for a return.\n\nHere we are two years in the future. BTC recovered from a -80% down from its ATH and even after then made another +200%. All that from - 80% to +200% happened in about one year. And today just a year later those FOMO levels are the new Fear levels.\n\nThat up and downs are completely normal for Crypto.

Dominant is a way that it was starting to become concerning that they hold too much power. 65% of the hashrate.\n\nControversies were flying around that BTC is their brain child to dominate the world economy. Well that FUD has been broken thanks to their own callousness, inability to comprehend their own power and shutting themselves off from the new paradigm. \n\nNevertheless they still hold 46% of the hashrate. Even despite the mining ban. However it has lost the 51% dominance and other countries like the US, Kazakhstan, etc are catching up.\n\nThe hashrate in China could continue to fall as their government keeps cracking down on the miners.\n\nThank you for giving us a hard reset and giving other countries a chance to catch up.\n\nEdit: By using \"China\", I was referring to their authoritarian government.

Maybe you're a part of the problem mate.\n\nYes scams will happen always but when the hive mentality \"its only 20/50$\" still exists, crypto will never be taken seriously and adopted at large.\n\nScams coins aren't gonna stop existing until the demand of them is non existant. And it's not a big amount but if 3.5mil people start using their brains and not their get overwhelmed by their \"where lambo\" mentality things might get a little bit better.\n\nStop spending your money in shitcoins and DYOR.

Because crypto is a 24/7 market, we get 2 days over the stock market. 4% of compounding interest over 365 means $100 investment today could turn into $164,880,329 a year from today. Now that\u2019s wife-changing money!\n\nWhy do I think this? Well, the fed stated will continue to increase rates over the next year. From that, I can deduce the market will increase at the same rate over the next year. \n\nI can\u2019t believe yesterday my wife was telling I was an idiot for losing half of our child\u2019s college money on \u201cmagic internet money.\u201d After I tell her that I\u2019ve only lost 40% of the money, she\u2019ll really be eating crow. \n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll know the bull run is back on.

Knowlege of average person in the internet about crypto is terrifying. Never saw so big amount of ignorance as superstition. Most people think it is fake internet money or biggest scam in history. And those people are not only boomers but millenials or gen z too. \n\nMain argument is that it is a scam, but ofc no one can logically answer why, they act  like medieval peasants toward \"witch\". No knowledge, just the same emotional repeated lies that crypto is dangerous, people lose money and my \"favourite\" that everyone should grow up and  work in 9-5 instead of wasting money and thinking about getting rich...

It is known internet hate any advices of making money, business or self improvement, but even most people that are seeking for bussines ideas, financial freedom and investing advices hate crypto.\n\n\nIs visiting those places necessary? I think yes. Too many people in crypto space don't understand real situation and are too optimistic. Some truth will be refreshing  like bucket of ice on their head. Instead of only spending time  in crypto subs or channels you will see reality. Here everything is about crypto, outside not. And even if is usually not friendly at all.

The vulnerability in question could have allowed the white hat hacker to change the order prices of cryptocureencies listed on Coinbase (think he can out any price for any crypto he wants and buy or sell BTC ETH at any price he wants). Not wouldn't have affected just Coinbase. Many DeFi projects also use Coinbase as a price oracle... so something like this happening could have triggered an extinction event to all crypto markets, possibly liquidating tens of billions, maybe a hundred billion dollars.\n\nMr. White hat wasn't joking when he said this was potentiallytially market nuking. The person who fixed optimism critical vulnerability was awarded with a $2 million bounty. No matter where you stand, this vulnerability was much bigger and it's impact could have been massive. \n\nCoinbase being Coinbase, deemed fit to reward our hacker with $250k, and there wasn't even any epic item to go with it. 3/10 would not do this quest again lmao.\n\nThis also shows a classic human behavior.

Hundreds of people in my community has been able to receive bags of food. \n\nI want to let you know that we have a new website where you can read a bit more about the project Meal Venezuela https://mealvenezuela.org/\n\nYou can also follow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/MealVenezuela\n\nSome pictures!\n\n[https://i.redd.it/1krqvf6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/1krqvf6goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/2grv5k6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/2grv5k6goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/8f3xso6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/8f3xso6goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/1e2ge07goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/1e2ge07goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/h824l87goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/h824l87goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/l1ppys6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/l1ppys6goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/h0t9mv6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/h0t9mv6goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/jurfxs6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/jurfxs6goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/no33nz6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/no33nz6goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/mqcz5q6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/mqcz5q6goys61.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/t6jpoq6goys61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/t6jpoq6goys61.jpg)\n\nIf you wish to help with cryptocurrency donations to buy food, please send funds to any of our addresses.

    "postText": "As an Iranian, Crypto has changed the life of Iranians for good. Especially during COVID-19 Seeing the post about Iran officially considering mining Bitcoin, I felt motivated to make this post as an Iranian. Cryptocurrency has changed the dynamics in Iran. The Iranian government's view on it has been quite lax compared to neighboring countries or other Muslim countries. There was either support for it or it was simply ignored since you couldn't really spend it on anything. On top of that, given the fact that Iran is disconnected from international banking, there was less concern from Iranian banks. (A bit ignorant, but I am not complaining)\n\nBut things have changed drastically over the past few years. The increased sanctions and COVID have brought a lot more people towards crypto, including me. Crypto has a very unique situation in Iran, which I will try to explain briefly. The Iranian currency is currently the cheapest in the world (or one of the cheapest, as its unstable and can change daily). So if someone can earn dollars and spend it in Iran, they are going to profit a lot. We are talking close to 25x increase. This makes mining insanely profitable. Because you are going to pay for your electricity in Iranian currency, but you are earning dollars, because crypto exchange rate is based on western currencies, not Iranian. So electricity is dirt cheap to begin with, but you can get it even cheaper.\n\nThere are ways to get free electricity in Iran. The government subsidizes businesses that have high electricity usage, so they get publicly funded electricity. So the owner of these businesses makes deals with individuals to buy hardware needed to mine currency (because the initial cost is very high due to currency difference), and usually one person with contacts overseas becomes the \"broker\" to be able to turn these cryptos into tangible money.  People without these businesses tend to form mining communities where they work together to discreetly mine and turn crypto into actual currency and due to the fact that a lot of people are dealing in crypto now, you can actually find a lot of buyers locally, and don't even need to sell it to foreigners.\n\nSo, this way crypto got introduced into society and a lot of people use it. Usually not as an investment, but as a currency you use to spend on things. Because in order to make an international purchase, you need to abuse a lot of loopholes, such as VPNs, middlemen and exchange rates. But now I can simply buy steam gift cards with bitcoin and use them to buy games. This applies to any international purchase. 60$ games used to cost a fortune, like an entire minimum wage income in Iran. Now they are widely available if you have crypto.\n\nThe usual mishandling of the Iranian government in regards to the economy is bad enough, but in recent years sanctions and COVID have made it a three way hell. My life personally was hell because I could not make any international purchase and I could barely make ends meet. Crypto is so empowering. I am basically able to earn and spend money despite the efforts of both Iranian and American governments. In order to put things in perspective,\u00a0I can use myself as an example. I am a lawyer and I earn more money from mining that I do practicing law. I am still working,\u00a0but crypto is a great secondary income which I can use to make international purchases without having to pay half of my income for a 100$ purchase. We are still in bad conditions, but crypto provides a lifeline. At least for now.\n\nI am grateful for cryptocurrency and this community, because the livelihood of many people in Iran relies on crypto and information about it. Most people involved in crypto trade in Iran don't even speak English, but know that an entire country is thankful for it, and the value of crypto could not be clearer. An entire people neglected by their own government and sanctioned by half the world, left to basically starve and live in terrible conditions, continue to go on. In large part, thanks to crypto currencies. We practically have the power to defy the strongest governments in the world, the next step is THE MOON.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions.",

    "postText": "Saying \"we are still early\" is setting yourself up for wildly unrealistic expectations Saying \"we are still early\" is a form of confirmation bias and coping mechanism people use when in reality we aren't that early anymore. Bitcoin has a trillion dollar market cap and is the 10th most valuable asset in the world. I wouldn't call that being \"early\" anymore. Ethereum is #15. Large companies are now buying these assets. The days of 100x your money in a year is basically over. As for the shitcoins that do do that, look at the volume at the start. Barely anyone was trading back then.\n\nDo I think there is still a lot of room for crypto to grow? Yes, but this isn't 2011 anymore. Most people who buy now aren't going to make insane gains and that's just the truth of it. There are 15,000 shitcoins in existence now, back in 2011 there were maybe 5. And the industry just started back then, now it's been around for 12 years. Much different ballgame now than it was back then. I'd say we are somewhere in the middle. Big gains can still be made but don't make the mistake of thinking this is 2011 and expecting a 1000x in one year.",

This is not everyday Crypto, this is historical.\n\nWith that it's highly impressive if you are still sticking around here and possibly even filling your bags with this discount. You are literally surviving one of the biggest bear markets in Crypto history while reading this, you are actually one of the last ones still actively being here.

Pay attention to the highlighted 0xfb654 address below:\n\n[Two addresses are receiving the exact same amount of wETH in a sale tx.

The multisig was [generated](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x3d69372255ff99a8ef09a4017666aaabf0a4465aab4f107b32868329fab95ab2) 14hrs before their [mints](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x5f8c593f7febcc4f388efa2f497231496de7d81053eeb8104f889160ffdabe40), so it's evident that it was made for this collection.\n\nOne [address](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x116311805390458bb65b2954290c2eb8c944e41d) has made three executive transactions (telling the multisig what to do), withdrawing a few MATIC at a time. This was likely a test to see if the multisig operated as intended.\n\nSeeing as this address is likely earning the royalties, and owns so many of the Trump Cards, this is almost certainly someone in Trump's organization.\n\nTo me it seems as though this multisig will sweep all of the cheap/floor price cards and then dump them all after they hit a specific price. Any regular person would sell at least a few when the price pumps, especially if they have a giant amount like 1k.\n\n# THIS COLLECTION WILL DUMP. DO NOT FOMO.",

All of us have at least once wished we had made a similar play to the one that [turned $17 into \\~6M](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21076574/he-invested-17-in-shiba-inu-now-he-has-almost-6m) or had gotten into the [right crypto at the right time.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/millennial-dogecoin-millionaire-on-being-paid-in-dogecoin.html) It\u2019s not like we are alone in this thought process - there are more than 1.7 million people right now trying to find the [next crypto moonshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/). For those who are out of the loop, a moonshot is something that has a low probability of becoming extremely successful \\[1\\].\n\nWhile it\u2019s definitely nice to be the guy who made the correct play, what I wanted to understand is, how likely are you to pick the next big coin?

Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1 -* ***Warren Buffet***\n\nWhile Warren Buffet might not be the best example for the crypto world, his advice holds true just as well in all investing spaces - Once you lose your capital, it\u2019s game over. So in this deep-dive, let's see how the less popular cryptos have performed over the years, whether it makes sense to invest in them, and finally, would you have made better returns just by investing in the top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?!\n\n### Data & Analysis Methodology\n\nAll the data used in the analysis has been collected from coinmarketcap.com.

There were only 67 listed coins in 2014. The list has grown to more than 3,000+ as of Jan 2022. All the data and my analysis are shared as a Rows sheet at the end.\n\nThe analysis is fairly simple and I have intentionally made the strategy straightforward so that it\u2019s easy to replicate. We will be comparing the performance of the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with the next 90 based on the total market cap of the coin.\n\n[The end of 2017 was definitely some wild time to be in the Crypto space.](https://preview.redd.it/ie9owd9mylv81.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=4830cb8e014e559cb2754b8f514a90a7f1787ac1)\n\nI have limited the analysis to the top 100 coins because of two reasons\n\n1. Even now, close to 95% of the combined market cap of the crypto market is contributed by just the top 100 coins. Adding to this, it becomes more and more difficult/riskier \\[2\\] to invest in coins having low market cap due to platform and liquidity issues.\n2. There are hundreds of new coins that are being launched every day. It\u2019s almost impossible to keep track of all the coins and realistically do proper due diligence before investing. So for practical feasibility, I am limiting it to the top 100.\n\n### Results\n\nBefore we jump straight into the return calculation, it\u2019s interesting to see how the crypto market has changed over the years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0fng8moylv81.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=98fb3edb350696ab03e9136c7b2eaf3ab9f46336\n\nIn the first few years where crypto was becoming mainstream (2014 to 2017), the top 10 currencies dominated the overall market cap contributing close to 99% \\[3\\]. Also, during crashes, we can observe a massive shift in capital allocation from Altcoin to Bitcoin \u2192 2017 was one of the best bull runs (barring 2021) where we can see that Bitcoin only contributed to \\~39% of the market cap. But once the bear market set in (2018-19), the allocation to bitcoin proportionally increased until the 2021 bull run.\n\n#### Creating a Crypto Index\n\nTo answer our initial question \u2192 Whether it\u2019s better to invest in the top 10 most popular cryptos or the other 90 relatively lesser-known ones, we will be creating an equal-weighted index \\[4\\].\n\nWe have two people Alan and Charlie who want to get into the crypto market in 2014, but both are following a slightly different approach.\n\nAlan will invest only in the top 10 most popular currencies. Every new year, he will go and check the top 10 cryptos by Market Cap and then equally invest between the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Charlie, on the other hand, will do the exact same thing with the only difference being that instead of the top 10, he will invest in the 90 next biggest cryptocurrencies.\n\nThey continue to do this over the next 8 years and now it\u2019s 2022 and it\u2019s time to see who has performed better.\n\n[Returns shown here are till Jan 1st, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/5u10wctsylv81.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=aacb02399d50dbd1d1874aba631a97dc354dbaab)\n\nWould you look at that! Alan who has invested in only the top-10 cryptos did vastly better than Charlie who went for the riskier play of investing in the not so well known currencies. The top 10 cryptos on average performed 5x better than the next 90 and 2x better than just investing in Bitcoin. What\u2019s even more interesting is that Charlie would have done 2x better just putting his money in Bitcoin - Ouch!\n\n#### Survival\n\nIf you are wondering why Charlie is getting the lowest return in spite of taking the most risk\\[5\\], it\u2019s because you are forgetting Rule 1 of investing - To not lose your initial investment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmntwr9vylv81.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c69754b5cbf65bc865d87a11ea5116baf9f5a70\n\nThe probability of survival of a coin is extremely skewed towards the top 10 currencies. As you can see, over 80% of the top 10 coins from 2014 are still in existence today compared to only 26% of the rest. This trend keeps repeating over the years and your capital would have been decimated. Once it goes to zero, there is no way for it to come back up as any gain on $0 is still 0!\n\n#### Moonshots\n\nFinally, we come to what we are all here for! What are our chances of actually hitting a moonshot following this strategy?\n\n[I have defined a 100x return as a Moonshot](https://preview.redd.it/j8oiifewylv81.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&s=fec161da3968b773bb1f96eca3da9c114da48cd9)\n\nWell, your chances of hitting a moonshot are also much higher following the top-10 strategy. Overall, you had a 1 in 10 chance of getting a 10,000% return compared to the 1 in 30 chance of the riskier next-90 strategy.\n\nThe above chart also shows another interesting stat \u2192 Out of the 500+ cryptos that we analyzed, less than 4% of them ended up becoming a moonshot. Think about that for a min - Of all the cryptos you are likely to hear about (*as there is very less coverage if it\u2019s not in the top 100*), only 3-4% of them end up giving you those insane returns. You have similar chances betting on a single number on the Roulette wheel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23hva9qyylv81.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf4c72e5515d1c77faa01aa82b29eaf590c6289\n\nAs you can see, of all our moonshots, Ethereum investment in 2016 ended up returning the most at a whopping 397,548%!\n\n### Limitations\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the limitations of the current analysis before trying to replicate it.\n\n1. **Data** \\- As I discussed earlier, all the data is from coinmarketcap and I have assumed a coin is dead if it\u2019s not listed in the following year\u2019s data. This analysis is only as strong as the quality of input data \\[6\\]. I have done extensive QCs but feel free to play around with the raw data to see if I missed something.\n2. **Base Effect** \\- The market is considerably different now than it was in 2015-17. There is more awareness as well as penetration. So the future growth might not be as explosive as the one that we observed in the past decade, so you should be realistic about your return potential\n3. **Intra Year Returns** \\- The current analysis only considers returns based on Jan 1st of every year starting from 2014. If we pick another date within the year, we might get slightly different results as there might have been ATHs and ATLs within the year which we are not capturing.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n>*It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong \u2014 George Soros*\n\nI started the analysis thinking that investing in the not-so-popular currencies is bound to give better returns as it\u2019s more likely they are undervalued due to lower publicity and hype associated with them.\n\nBut, as we saw from the data, in the case of crypto it\u2019s much more profitable just to invest in the top currencies. It\u2019s like the case where being in the game is much more important than trying to hit it big and striking out!\n\n***If you liked this post, you might like my other analysis on Crytpo:*** [How to consistently make returns from the Crypto market by using Dollar Cost Averaging](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/crypto-dca?s=w)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Data:** All the data used in the analysis [**can be found here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/untitled-spreadsheet-3-7fuGkqeJVN8gkvISEezt43/live) *(it\u2019s a treasure-trove of information IMO as you can filter based on the rank, price, market cap - however you like it. All I ask is that if you can find a better strategy based on this data, do let us all know!)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Footnotes** \n\n\\[1\\] The [word](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/moonshot) itself is derived from the Apollo 11 spaceflight project and is often used to classify something that seems almost impossible.\n\n\\[2\\] Extremely small coins are more likely to face liquidity issues, consolidated ownerships, and rug pulls.\n\n\\[3\\] For comparison, the top 10 companies in S&P 500 only contribute <30% of the index and that itself is considered to be extremely skewed by some analysts.\n\n\\[4\\] An equal-weighted index is where we invest equally regardless of the market cap of the crypto. All the famous indices like S&P500 are market cap-weighted - i.e, bigger companies get a bigger chunk of your investment\n\n\\[5\\] I mean the 2,000% return is no joke \u2192 S&P 500 barely gave a 100% return over the same period. It\u2019s all relative, eh!\n\n\\[6\\] [Garbage in, garbage out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out)",

    "postText": "Sell walls: What they are, what they do, and how to spot them. Browsing reddit, see a lot of people asking what sell walls are, and an equal number of people giving a poor explanation of their actual purpose. I was going to reply in a comment, but I feel that a lot of people can benefit from a short write-up on them.\n\n#What is a sell wall?\n\nA sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.\n\nA sell wall looks like this on the depth chart: http://brettwestbrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-12.58.10-PM.png\n\n###How does it work?\n\nThis is best explained as an example.\n\nA wealthy person, we will call him Richard, tells a group of his wealthy friends that he wants to make money on a particular stock. This could be for a number of reasons such as:\n\n* The stock has a lot of room to grow\n* The stock can be easily manipulated\n* The stock has a lot of potential to get big in the near future\n\nRichard and his friends decide that it's a good idea. They all want 1 million of X cryptocurrency. *Unfortunately, in the cryptocurrency market Richard and his friends can't execute all the buy orders at once or the prices will skyrocket!* \n\n\nTo achieve 1 million obtained goal, they decide to set up a sell wall, and manipulate the price downwards. They do this in steps:\n\n1. They accumulate together. They will maybe get 250,000 of X crypto each. In their specific market, this didn't affect the price that much. Great! \n\n2. They now set a specific price they feel is low enough for them to be able to reach their 1m X crypto goal. For this particular crypto they decide to all sell their obtained crypto at $2.40.\n\n3. Now, between Richard and the group, there is >1 million dollars worth of X crypto selling for @2.40 on the market, a seemingly undervalued price.There is SO much volume being sold now, buying pressure cannot eat through that wall in a reasonable time frame - it would take a very high buying pressure to do so. \n\nWhat also happens next is the key: nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it's gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards.\n\nRichard and his friends can now safey all get to their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially! When they decide to rid their sell walls the price moves up accordingly!\n\n##How can you use this to your advantage?\n\nA common thought is that the main goal of a sell wall is to instill fear into the weaker hands so that they sell by the thought that \"Oh no everyone is selling!!\" While it's not the main purpose, it probably does happen a little bit. People get nervous when things a large volume of crypto is being sold.\n\nAs Warren Buffet said: *Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.*\n\nFor a real life example:\n\nVECHAIN. \n\nFor those that don't know, about a month ago vechain was sitting around 29 cents. They had a pretty large announcement that was, yes, front page of reddit. The price nearly doubled to 70 cents (it actually happened right before the announcement). \n\nWhat happened after? Some people bought the rumor and sold the news. But, this news was really big. Masternodes, rebranding, big partnerships. Ask any VEN holder why the price didn't continue to rise after that and they will probably know why - price manipulation with sell walls.\n\nSuch as: https://i.redd.it/bjaubsgn04601.png\n\nVECHAIN has had a lot of new partnerships, announcements, and generally great news to propel the crypto further, but has been held back by these sells walls constantly. Just recently buying pressure has been very high and the whales have been having trouble controlling it they way they would like.\n\nThat's a real example of what has been happening. Take a look at roadmaps and see where different projects are at in development. Are any projects getting seemingly great news without moving in price?\n\nWhat about REQ? We saw a couple of front page posts about REQ moving to main net, quality pictures from the UI, etc etc. REQ was fairly stagnant around 30 cents before slingshotting to 80 cents in nearly a day. Sell walls and price manipulation.This field is speculative so any news drives buying pressure. Unfortunately, the very wealthy have a say as well. \n\nLook for great projects and determine if they solve a need. Look to see what's hitting the media's spot light, such as the front page here. **THEN take a look at the depth charts on the exchanges.** In crypto anything goes, and you better believe the very wealthy have difficult to obtain knowledge. When you see these obvious sell walls, you want to investigate and try to identify any trends. \n\nPerhaps you can look at **volume** of a cryptocurrency. A stagnant crypto with LOTS of volume is a huge indicator, sideways consolidation. Ripple did this for a few weeks, even months at certain stages. \n\nOnce you find one that looks good - **you'll need to hold at the mercy of the whales.** Trust me, they want profit more than you do. The wait is almost always worth it because price will rise very rapidly once selling pressure is completely abolished.\n\n\nHope this helps guys. \n\nP.s. I\u2019m not a financial consultant, this is just helpful information or fun facts if you will.",

I literally have screenshots of conversations that say this much.\n\nYou are being throttled out. They can indeed scale up at a cost.\n\nIf for some reason they can not they have a fiduciary duty the moment they take your funds to tell you the risk of their incapable IT architecture and settings. Moreover, they could just install a kill switch that ends trades without penalty if the web servers go down or they exceed band width.\n\nAs cost-effective as it is to build in a kill switch as a solution its not profitable to exchanges that are having a liquidity crisis. Assets on exchanges are becoming more scarce. (reference IEP 1559 and many other facets)\n\nIf an exchange restricts your access they should still not be placing higher priority orders via the OTC desk while you are locked out. This should also be disclosed.\n\nWhile they may say we dont make money indirectly off insurance funds they absolutely do.\n\nCloudflare is the brand of edge network they are using as a server to facilitate HSTS protocol controls to throttle down access to their whim.

The one where they banned me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHMMMMMMMMMMMM thats a bit SUS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*edit update\\*\n\nI am getting alot of questions and a TON mof messages with horror stories and people asking for help\n\nThe big question is do they know about this\n\nI personally PM'd the CEO u/johnny_kucoin and he responded\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15078yhmv9v71.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=36514913d56552d7ac0146efd43a99963a06ae3c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uti2xancv9v71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=fad92498b3d0a9950a62c35690ee8030955246fc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nw5noo5kqav71.jpg?width=3121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6599cad3ce8fe23bffa1f6c7ce92aad7cd6f9a58\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1umcp0nqav71.jpg?width=2601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f45affd38a8dfbbcd34a3138c54a0dd5056b5ca5\n\nHow else do they know ( they are knowingly doing this)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow this works is Amazon data centers charges you by the cumulative resources you consume. ( cpu, gpu, data storage, ram etc)\n\nIn these settings you can throttle the virtual machine/ cloud servers resources forcing it to go down. I am not implying that they are doing this.\n\nI am saying they are knowingly using settings that let the server go down repeatedly. There are formulas to calculate loads on concurrent users. They are clearly not using settings or intentionally using settings that trip the server to go down.\n\nIf you dig through this archive you can see when outages are being reported. They get a system notice that they hit a threshold of resource utilization.\n\n[https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/](https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/)\n\nNow in the event, you have a crazy anomaly Cloudflare and Amazon have the ability to redirect to a redundant location with a technology called geo load balancing\n\n[https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-gateway-load-balancer-is-now-available-in-additional-9-regions/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-gateway-load-balancer-is-now-available-in-additional-9-regions/)\n\nNotice in my screenshot that it says there is a gateway issue\n\nthat link talks about load balancing the gateway ( offloading the processing power)\n\nThey VERY MUCH KNOW THEY ARE DOING THIS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInfact I let the CEO know via PM\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8myd59tpoav71.jpg?width=3307&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5843459f892d65f25a6735c38cf647bcf0fb7f91\n\nthe date on that PM is Sept 29th\n\nThey had another outage this past weekend and even today\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtenjo5zoav71.jpg?width=2873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=555fe15ee5c769c5dda0ff3198f21f3bf7bb352f\n\nand email\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8ibbasepav71.jpg?width=3375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b1563e3d6f8c5fa98d7963f86cc6cc0da13b84d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kywbo6wpav71.jpg?width=3338&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b927e221153ac266d5b43ff21f89edd0f8a5f94f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially thier help desk team does nothing and they keep passing you back and forth until you give up.\n\nIn professional management the term for this is \"being managed out\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I share these communications just to show THEY DAMN WELL KNOW AND NEVER DISPUTE WHAT I SAY\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThey are getting system notices  via email from amazon (e.g. You are at 89% cpu utilization you need to scale or you may face faliure)\n\nTheir Amazon (AWS) sales guy is calling them every day trying to sell them more services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne.g. Hey i am your hypothetical Amazon Sales Guy \" I noticed you guys are throttling cpu load on webservers, can I offer you a bigger package and maybe we should tal;k about fail over locations incase your server goes down under load.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfrankly, I would bet my life on it that they know this is an issue and why\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere isnt a data center architect  (what I did) on the planet that couldn't answer why their servers are going down.  This is 101 level stuff\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey also have the ability to kill the back end server ( where trades happen) this is done on all major exchanges  like the HK ex\n\n[https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/Market-Communications/2016/160425news?sc\\_lang=en](https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/Market-Communications/2016/160425news?sc_lang=en)\n\n[https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/exchanges/hkex-to-introduce-kill-switch-on-hk-securities-market/](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/exchanges/hkex-to-introduce-kill-switch-on-hk-securities-market/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand Chicago CME\n\n[https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/webhelp/globex-credit-controls/Content/Kill-Switch.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/webhelp/globex-credit-controls/Content/Kill-Switch.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially the webserver sends a hearth beat signal  ( its literally called that) if the heartbeat is not heard all trades pause ( a kill switch)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat\\_(computing)#:\\~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20heartbeat,parts%20of%20a%20computer%20system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20heartbeat,parts%20of%20a%20computer%20system).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is VERY common design work, like windows to a house level ... for lack of better comparrison\n\nIn Kucoins instance they let the webserver go down but the back end server was still moving. All the whales use OTC desks and have dedicated access. So they processed the whale orders and let all of us burn alive and took our money\n\nIts safe to say they have ZERO plausible deniability\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can share screen shots with thier help desk if its hellp ful\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went so far as to volunteer to fix the issue for free,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8txyhgqux9v71.png?width=2133&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ea469c5f87a1ce92bc9c245b7c3e58c4563db7f\n\nThe CEO went so far as to acknowledge the outage happened and they would do the right thing but it was all BULL SH!t\n\nIT was a PR stunt and no one go money anywhere close to thier losses.

Like they messed up and don't know any better\n\nWell I hope not\n\nWould you run a business solely on the web that handles over $1 billion dollars of transactions daily without a single redundancy fail-over site for high availability which is a ubiquitous industry standard?\n\nIf you had issues with web server outages more than all of your competitors and relied on transaction fees for income... there would be an obvious question of \"doesn't downtime hurt your income from transaction fees if your customer cant process transactions?\n\nIf they are honest... they are so grossly incompetent they are still just as big of a threat.\n\nOccam's razor is **a principle of theory construction or evaluation** according to which, other things equal, explanations that posit fewer entities, or fewer kinds of entities, are to be preferred to explanations that posit more.\n\nSo what is more plausible is\" a company rose to #3 by market cap and is processing over 1 billion a day in transactions but yet never heard of the industry-standard redundancies.\n\nThey cant figure out how to stop the loss of income from amissing transaction fees\n\nThey also never address that they have more outages during periods of high liquidity transfer ( not volume) than all of their competitors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet still, appease their institutional customers moving $35 million in assets or more?\n\nor\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat they are pulling an industry-standard broker tactic of pulling out the proverbial buy/ sell button of securities when they may have a liquidity crisis. \\* Like Robinhood did with GMC, AMC, and Dogecoin. While still catering to whales\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope they show up to answer these questions.\n\nBecause of the derivative funding fees, the constant issues with withdrawals (often you can't withdraw), deleting stop losses, not triggering stop losses and removing the liquidation price  on margin contracts increasing the risk of liquidation makes me want to ask a lot of questions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I started to ask these questions I got instantly banned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I looked up there moderators and saw they were teh executives of the comapny and tagged them, they made the mod list private.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThrough this all, I am still willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but your don't get to lock me out of my house and then burn it to the ground.. subsequently blame me for it.\n\nThey tried to silence me when I asked questions.\n\nThere is something off here!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "postText": "Cryptocurrencies would NOT have saved the people of Afghanistan...... I am a person who fled from Afghanistan in the year 2000......back when the Taliban was in charge as well. It is horrible for me to see them rise to power again today.\n\nMy family is still in Kabul. I can tell you that cryptocurrencies would not have saved them. As soon as other countries heard of the Taliban rising, they closed all embassies so nobody could get a visa. It used to be easy to get out of the country to atleast Pakistan, India or China but they too closed their borders when the Taliban march became too 'real'. With no passports, no visums and no money for 90% of the Afghan people, where would they go?\n\nAs more and more provinces were being taken, more and more people were forced to go to Kabul. Most of these fugitives had fought against the taliban in their own province and were now forced to sleep in the parks, on the ground and in the parkings lots. The locals of Kabul spared them whatever food they could.......\n\nWhen the Taliban circled Kabul, hyperinflation occured. Prices of all foods skyrocketed out of fear of dying of starvation. Do you really believe cryptocurrencies could have changed this?\n\n**I think not.**\n\nAlso what many people don't realise is that many in Afghanistan are UNBANKED. They only hold some cash and use it to buy stuff. Cash would be more useful in this scenario than having cryptocurrencies on some exchange or even in your wallet. What if they turn off the internet? They will surely censor a large part of the internet if not compeletly turn it off. I remember back in 2000, you weren't even allowed to listen to music, hold a wedding etc. I fear for my family but all I can do is pray.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\n1. Some people are asking 'who said this' => This post was mostly a reaction to the **comments** in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p50c9y/people_flocking_to_empty_banks_and_atms_in/) (not to OP!). Also, if you read through the comments in this post, you will find people with similar ideas here.\n2. I am grateful to all those who are writing kind words to me and my family. Your warm words have a profound effect on the heart. Ideally, I would like to thank every one of you personally, but this post has grown much larger than I expected and I am no longer at capacity to do so.

    "postText": "I gave each of my dogs $100 to invest in crypto. I will give them the rewards when they turn 18 (~3 dog years) Being a man of science who also loves his dogs and crypto, this was an opportunity I could not pass on. Like the title says, I \"gave\" each of my dogs $100 to invest in crypto and plan on giving them the rewards (probably in the form of special treats, food, toys) when they reach the appropriate age.\n\nFor practical reasons I did not create accounts for them in an exchange, we will be using my account instead and I will be managing their funds for the time being. Just imagining how long the verification (kyc) process would take for them gave me a headache. Moreover, my dogs are still not very good using the keyboard or touchscreens, so it made more sense for me to do it.\n\nEven though I am technically managing the funds for them, they were actually the ones who decided which projects were worth investing in. In order to save time I decided it would be best to show them the logo of each crypto and read them the name, if they barked, that meant they wanted me to buy some. I decided to allocate their $100 in three equal parts among the first 3 projects they barked at. This way they would have a diverse portfolio.\n\nThe results were the following:\n\n* Gandalf the Beagle (DOGE, CAKE, SHIBA)\n* Attila the Pug (DOGE, BAT, ADA)\n\nLike I said, the decision was theirs, I have to respect it. Gandalf was probably just hungry at the moment and thought I was offering him cake and the sight of a doge and shiba dogs made him happy. Attila probably chose doge for the same reason, and I guess he reacted at the word \"bat\" because he hates bats. At first I was surprised when he chose ADA. I thought he had probably been reading up on the project and read about the smart contracts being implemented today. Now I just thing he though I said \"ADA BOYYY\".\n\nI will let you know how these investments turn out, remember it's important to think about your pets' financial future as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow thanks everyone I1m glad you were entertained, btw these are some of the funniest comments I have ever seen!",

Everything was going according to plan and the next morning I got up to make my trade, only to find more than $1000 was missing from my USD funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The $11 buy was with separate money](https://preview.redd.it/ikvei79uho871.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb7a73aebf9c8f9d99d08c7ee3eb8b3a0d2f495)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the amount I woke up to](https://preview.redd.it/o9qb57q2io871.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5dbc5c56de1c1a24a54598b6d3e6167b46d21fb)\n\nConfused, I tried to reach out to [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) to no avail.  I did some research and found out people have been waiting months for tickets to be resolved.  That was unacceptable to me, so I filed formal complaints with the BBB and the SEC, of which both cases are still open at the time of this writing.\n\nToday, [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) emailed me back and notified me they removed $1000 from my trade because \"their records\" show a deposit I made on the 25th of June never went through.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the first indication I got of where the money went](https://preview.redd.it/x4y4wdp8jo871.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f94935728d624b64c5456677d638fdcfe13320b)\n\nConfused, I logged into my bank account to check my account and sure enough, there was a transaction for $1000 on June 25th.\n\n[Bank Statement](https://preview.redd.it/b7r6h0fkjo871.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3c42ed146079c84c70640419107325757db1a1d)\n\nThe most alarming thing about this is that [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) gave me ZERO indication that they were doing this, and if I wasn't the type of person who pays very close attention to his account, that money would have been gone forever with me being none the wiser.  There were no emails, no alerts, nothing on my account, zilch, to indicate what they did.  And to top it all off, it was done in the middle of the night, somewhere between 3-4am PST, as the market was falling.  So when I woke up, the PNL looked as if it was a normal red day.  To top it all off, they took MORE than $1000 when they removed the money from my account.\n\nIf you guys are using [Binance.US](https://Binance.US), get your money off of that exchange ASAP and watch your funds like a hawk.  There will likely be a lawsuit that stems from these types of practices, and it shows that [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) is being grossly incompetent with people's money to the point of negligence.  Please do not use them and use this message to protect yourself.\n\n\nUPDATE: Binance.US is doubling down and saying they never received the funds.  I called my bank and they confirmed the transaction did go through in a timely manner.  \n\nI traced out my bank statement with my USD deposits on Binance.US and they match up perfectly, minus the $1000 + a few extra they took without telling me.",

This means proof of stake validators are also exempted, if this passes. \n\nBut it still does not contain the exception for protocol and wallet developers. This is the important aspect that needs to be included as an exception, as it is impossible for protocol developers/wallet developers etc to KYC their users. \n\nKeep calling and asking your Senators to do the right thing.\n\nWatch the Senate proceedings here: https://www.senate.gov/legislative/floor_activity_pail.htm\n\nFollow the Senators votes here: https://didtheyvoteagainst.me/\n\nUpdate: Senator Steve Daines, from Montana has tweeted in favor of the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey Amendment!\n\nJeff Stein (Washington Post) says additional changes are still expected before the vote.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, Senator Marsha Blackburn are committed to Wyden/Lummis/Toomey Amendment\n\n\n**UPDATE**: The latest amended text specifically carves out exceptions for both proof of work, and proof of stake. By name, it mentions these 2 consensus as mining and staking. Other consensus mechanisms aren't mentioned. Still no exception for developers - which is still KEY.\n\n**Senate breaks filibuster to advance $1.2 trillion infrastructure package.**\n\n**UPDATES:** WaPo reporter claiming further amendments are due! Wtf?! \nThey are really legislating about things they have no clue about. Apart from PoW and PoS, there is proof of history, proof of capacity, proof of storage.. so many new technologies that are being built. How does Sen Warner and his staff even know about any of this, do they have crypto experts on their team? This is just a farce!",

I know at the moment even though the amount of moons per karma has decreased incredibly it\u2019s still such an amazing concept to get your head around. Rewarding the user with tokens that could potentially earn the users money just for providing good content is extraordinary. This seems like a good step in the right direction instead of things like likes on Instagram where their only value is self esteem. In addition, it\u2019s not focused on appearance so it\u2019s a lot less biased; anyone with a good thing to say will be upvoted no matter what they look like. \n\nNext is brave and BATS. I understand that if brave went mainstream then they would earn a ridiculous amount of money through advertisement but this would also then be split with the person that\u2019s getting the advertisement shoved down their throat. I know I would personally prefer to get payed for being manipulated by ads then just be manipulated for free. Not to mention the other benefits brave has to offer. \n\nI think that this is just the start and I\u2019m extremely excited to see where this concept of rewarding the user can go!",

I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.\n\n>What is happening?\n\n* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/\n\n* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.\n\n>Why is this happening?\n\n * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in.\n\n * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.\n\n>How can I save money?\n\n * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money\n\n * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later\n\n * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)\n\n>What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date)\n\n * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts.\n\n * EIP-1559: Est \"this summer, but maybe Q3\": A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving \"gas inflation\" like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions\n\n * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until \"the merge\". Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :)\n\n * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain. \n\n * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today\n\n * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability\n\n>What other out-of-order improvements are coming?\n\n * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to \"get in\", then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.\n\nI know a lot of people are unhappy with the current situation, but a lot of progress has been made and a lot of exciting progress is on the horizon! I hope this post helps :)",

    "postText": "These are the 6 U.S. Senators at fault for killing the crypto industry in the U.S. Vote them out! You've probably heard by now that, despite our best efforts, the U.S. Senate *failed to even vote* on any alternative to the horrible cryptocurrency provision that may kill the crypto industry in the U.S. This means that wallet producers, miners, Dapp creators, and basically everyone else will now require KYC of their customers/users or face harsh penalties from the IRS (the U.S. tax collector). These are the 6 Senators (listed in no particular order) who are responsible for the cryptocurrency disaster in the Infrastructure Bill. We will remember their actions and vote them out!\n\n**Rob Portman (R-OH)** \u2013 drafted the disastrous, original cryptocurrency provision. When Toomey, Wyden, and Lummis introduced an amendment to fix the provision, Rob Portman publicly supported their amendment before blindsiding everyone with his own, worse amendment. Portman has proved himself to be a puppet for Janet Yellen and Wall Street.\n\n**Mark Warner (D-VA)** \u2013 wrote the worse crypto amendment with Rob Portman, creating chaos in the Senate and causing Portman to recant his previous support of the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment. Because the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis was bipartisan and already widely expected to pass, Mark Warner\u2019s co-authorship of the Portman amendment gave the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment bipartisan sponsorship, giving it legitimacy to contend the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment.\n\n**Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)** \u2013 did not write the worse crypto amendment with Portman and Warner, but signed onto the amendment later to give it legitimacy. Kyrsten Sinema was one of the two leaders of the Senate Infrastructure Bill negotiations, along with Rob Portman. Once Sinema signed onto the Portman/Warner amendment, it became extremely difficult for other senators to publicly oppose the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment, because it became a symbolic rejection of the Infrastructure Bill as a whole. This is why we only saw Republicans who already indicated they would vote against the Infrastructure Bill publicly commit to the better, Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment.\n\n**Bill Hagerty (R-TN)** \u2013 99 out of 100 Senators voted to expedite the Infrastructure Bill, which would have led to an opportunity for proper consideration, debate, and voting on the cryptocurrency amendments. Bill Hagerty was the ONLY Senator to vote against expedition. This forced the Senate to either take a vote to end debate and force a vote on the *whole* Infrastructure Bill within 30 hours, or to take a recess until September 13, 2021. Once the Senate voted to end debate, it meant that the cryptocurrency amendments would not even be voted on without unanimous consent of all 100 Senators. Hagerty effectively increased the number of Senators who needed to support a crypto amendment from 60 to 100.\n\n**Richard Shelby (R-AL)** \u2013 99 out of 100 Senators consented to vote on the mega-compromise Toomey/Lummis/Warner/Portman/Sinema amendment which was substantially similar to the good Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment. It was widely expected to pass, and we would have seen a resounding success. However, Richard Shelby was the ONLY Senator to refuse to consent, because he conditioned his consent on the Senate also approving $50 billion in military spending. When this idiotic ultimatum was rejected, Richard Shelby objected to the cryptocurrency amendment, leaving Portman\u2019s disastrous, original cryptocurrency provision intact.\n\n**John Thune (R-SD)** \u2013 the Senate Minority Whip. His ONE job is to make sure that the Republican senators vote with party leadership. He failed this TWICE by allowing Bill Hagerty and Richard Shelby to block the crypto amendments. How hard could it be to get corrupt politicians to vote with a corrupt party? Just promise to give the Republicans candy if they vote with the party. I used that strategy to win my middle school student government election in a landslide.\n\nAlso, fuck **Janet Yellen**. The unelected, 74-year-old Secretary of the Treasury was the person behind the cryptocurrency provision in the first place, as well as the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment. It\u2019s no surprise that the woman who took $7.2 million in speaking fees over the last two years (almost entirely from banks) was behind this attempt, at every step of the way, to systematically destroy cryptocurrency and DeFi. And of course, because she was unelected, we have no way to vote her out.",

So why is it awarded that much? **Bots.** There is so much to make in this market if you are a scammer, that buying bots and letting them guild and upvote your post is worth it.\n\nAlso the flair: Everyone can post that \"solid fundamentals\" flair. Even better: There are only 4 flairs of which 2 are \"solid fundamentals\" so if you don't tag your coin yourself as shitcoin it's basically automatically a coin with \"solid fundamentals\".

    "postText": "The government should not tax and profit from Crypto while claiming it is worthless. Not whining, just an honest question since I live in a country with no Crypto taxes. Considering what the Politicians, the SEC and the bankers say about Cryptocurrencies,  it should be pretty clear that Cryptocurrencies hold NO value whatsoever. They consider it to be a worthless and useless asset.\n\nIf that's true, then why do people have to pay taxes on Crypto? People should not be paying any taxes for holding a useless asset. The same politicians and government bankers who call Crypto worthless receive a part of their paycheck from taxes collected from Crypto. It is clearly hypocritical to tax Cryptocurrencies and profit from it while calling it worthless at the same time.",

New website vechain.org.\n* 36:31 - 37:25 - BMW Group announcement + End\n*\n\n\nToday, VeChain Foundation hosted the rebrand event showcasing the consortium chain VeChain to the public blockchain VeChainThor. This event was an invite-only occasion for media and partners with a live stream to YouTube. During the event, Sunny Lu and Luca Crisciotti of DNV GL talked about the past, present, and future of VeChain. \n\nSunny clarified that VeChain's uniqueness is not only technical but also its understanding of ecosystems. He pointed to the governance and economic models as examples. This sentiment was echoed by Luca as he assured everyone that after meeting with countless blockchain solution representatives he chose VeChain as the partner for DNV GL because of their understanding and dedication to the customer. \n\nThis mindset has lead to over 180 opportunities for VeChain in 2018. Many of these opportunities are left unannounced, but in the course of the event, VeChain announced several new partners and opportunities including the University of Oxford Mathematical Institute, Carbon Bank solutions, BitOcean ICO, food sourcing, and BMW Group. \n\nAlso in this event, Sunny Lu showcased three decentralized applications (DApps) that are being built to cater towards the mainnet launch. Those DApps include:\n\n* VeVID -  KYC and digital ID maintenance solution that can be native to all VeChain applications or partners. [You can read the official announcement here.](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechains-first-official-public-infrastructural-decentralized-application-vevid-cd97bdf98670) \n\n* VeVOT - A voting service that will be initially used by the VeChain governance model. This solution will be available for other general voting events to be logged on the blockchain such as government voting and board votes. Voting results will be audited by independent partners and certified on the blockchain. \n\n* VeSCC - Smart contracts on the VeChainThor mainnet can be categorized into certified and uncertified, which can be checked in the explorer. The certification of smart contracts covers various aspects including the identity of the owner, the legality of the purpose, and the security of the source code. \n\nAt the event, the carbon bank solution was made public to raise awareness that VeChain is building solutions alongside DNV GL that will monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint. This solution is being used and researched by universities (Tsinghua University), businesses, and government bodies.\n\nIn this event Sunny Lu took the time to introduce the University of Oxford (Mathematical Institute) as a partner in the VeChain ecosystem and will be working on assuring the economic model is working as intended for VET holders, VeThor users, and new customers. It was also mentioned that Japanese FSA certified partner BitOcean would be the first ICO on VeChainThor.\n\nLuca Crisciotti left with words of encouragement of VeChain \u201cWe are not talking about pilot projects, we are talking about solutions that are working for real cases.\u201d Luca went on to say:\u201cDNV GL is a company with over 150 years of history. And unfortunately, this is something we can not share, because you [VeChain] were only born a few months ago. But we do have something in common, and it's a bright future. So thank you Sunny for the partnership and this amazing event.\u201d \n",

    "postText": "Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador a month ago. It is not going well. This is a post about the cryptocurrency situation in El Salvador. I am posting this again because the previous one was removed by a bot. It is not about price, it should not be marked as such.\n\nTwitter post as proof of living in El Salvador: https://nitter.net/samsungsv19/status/1446177713413308428#\n\nA month ago, Bitcoin became another Salvadoran currency. I understand that my previous posts looked like complete FUD, but that's not my intention. I wanted to share how all of this affected Salvadorans, specially for those who barely have money to get a \"decent\" mobile device.\n\nAdoption is going pretty bad, specially because of identity theft. There have been hundreds of reports about people using the Chivo Wallet to steal money. The government is being quiet about it, and no one is offering a solution to the problem:\n\n\n>https://diario.elmundo.sv/denuncian-robo-de-datos-personales-para-uso-no-autorizado-de-chequera-chivo/\n\n\nThat is not a case of phishing or people authorizing full access to the Chivo Wallet, this is way worst. The Chivo Wallet \"has facial recognition\", or so they said however it is just storing a picture, any picture. There is no validation whatsoever, and because of that people are no longer using/trusting Bitcoin:\n\n\n>https://imgur.com/a/7vRTft8\n\n\nAnd yes, I know you are going to say that this does not have anything to do with Bitcoin, but you gotta understand the Salvadoran culture: Once something fails, everything associated to it becomes bad. It doesn't make sense, I know, but that's how things really are here, and it is affecting adoption.\n\nBusinesses are reporting low adoption. 93.1% of small/medium business are reporting ZERO Cryptocurrency transactions. The free bitcoin bonus was either converted to FIAT or spent in groceries, after that usage crashed.\n\nWhat about the protests? Did people finally accept the Bitcoin Law passed by the Salvadoran congress?\n\nNot quite.\n\nThere were two protests:\n\n- September 15th\n\n- September 30th\n\nBoth protests were massive, huge turnout. People are angry, and mad. Salvadorans do not want The Bitcoin Law:\n\nSeptember 30th Protest against the Bitcoin Law \n\n>https://imgur.com/gallery/izClFXl\n\n\nA protestor in front of Congress throwing spaguetti. The government has been giving people bags of spaghetti and tuna for months. \n\n>https://imgur.com/gallery/vcSpiOw\n\nMore photos of the protests:\n\n>https://imgur.com/gallery/oTBmKXL\n\n\n>https://imgur.com/gallery/Yflx5gi\n\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/NRUp3yx\n\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/wveAR41\n\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/IaP1YGR\n\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/ysl1jvC\n\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/3HEf4z7\n\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/hO23Vil\n\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/zu263IQ\n\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/61W1rmh\n\n\nWhat was President Bukele's response?\n\nJust like Donald Trump, he chose to mock the protests via Twitter:\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/NhAqko0\n\nThree protests, and instead of listening to the people, he decide to just ignore them, and make fun of them.\n\nAre Salvadorans protesting because they dont understand technology? Are they afraid of changes? Why they don't want free money?\n\nWell, salvadorans are protesting because this whole Bitcoin Law thing has been shady. First of all, remember the \"Not your keys, not your money\" thing that you see pretty often here? We don't know where the 700 bitcoins that the President Bukele bought are. Who is our broker? How much did we pay for those bitcoins? What about the free 30 dollar bonus? How much did it cost? All information regarding the purchase of Bitcoin is classified. \n\nWhat about the ATMs? We only know that a known Bitcoin ATM company provided them, but the cost of those 200 ATMs is classified information because of \"National Security\" (whatever that is). \n\nBut hey! El Salvador is mining Bitcoin with vulcanoes! \n\nYeaaaaaaaaah, about that.... It is true, but it is not a new well, nor new infraestructure. The mining farm is located in a poor town called Berlin, Usulutan. LaGeo is the name of the state-owned company that produces geothermal electricity for the Oriental Region (Usulutan and San Miguel), however due to the mining farm, we are starting to burn more coal to provide enough energy to the region. Electricity costs are rising up, but our President puts profits over people.\n\nProfits over people you say? Covid cases/cases are going up, but Bukele is not restricting movement because that would be a fatal blow to the Chivo Wallet adoption. You see, if people cant go outside they cant go to the Chivo Offices to set up the wallet and learn how to use it. Bukele cares more about profits, and spends his days tweeting about bitcoin prices (Trump would be so proud):\n\n>http://imgur.com/gallery/ma4IgAY\n\nWhat is next? Another protest is scheduled for October 17th, and rumor has it that it will be bigger than the previous one. Will Congress concede and roll back the Law? We dont know.",

    "postText": "The mass adoption won't happen until \"Apple\" of crypto comes along. It's pretty simple really. To get mass adoption to the levels we want, we need an iPhone style event into the market, by some massive and already well-established company. Sure LG and other companies made touch screen phones before Apple did, but Apple did it better and they made it much more simple to use. They've dumbed down the whole thing, so even half-trained monkey could do it.\n\nThis is what we need in crypto. Right now all we have is a crap-ton of different chains, bridges, multiple ecosystems, multiple wallets etc. it's just too much for the average Joe. Heck, even for myself it was truly difficult to sell one coin the other day (not gonna shill here any names). It took me around 12 different steps, moving between bridges, converters and so on etc. before I was finally able to cash it out to FIAT without destroying myself with high fees to make it worthwhile. Sure, I could just cash out via traditional methods, but I'd lose like 15% of my coins doing that. This stuff should be automated a long time ago.\n\nBut this will take time, a lot of time. The true adoption will start when we are allowed to just add crypto to our Google Pay or Apple Pay by scanning a quick QR code from our crypto wallet, without thinking two secs or giving a single fuck if our coins are going to disappear because we've mistyped one or two letters in the wallet. Or because your wallet supports coins X, Y, Z but not coins A, B, C. Until then \"mass adoption\" is just an empty slogan that won't happen for another 10 years or more.\n\nEdit: Reddit gold?!

Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. \n\nVCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.\n\nSo a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. \n\n\nWhen Solana goes down - over night fix.\n\nWhen bridge hacked? - overnight fix. \n\nHow long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?\n\nEdit: The mental gymnastics of SOlshills is just incredible. They have clearly consumed all the kool aid in the world to be supportive of this kind of institution manipulation. Yes, other projects also have VCs, and Eth projects have also been hacked. Yet none of the ETH projects have been bailed out in this manner by VCs and institutions. I have been extremely critical of ETH too. There is virtually a hack a day on Eth due to poor code or implementation or bugs, but none of the ETH project hacks have been \"replenished\" by institutions. If an ETH projects gets hacked and people lose money, well you are shit out of luck. As evidenced by hundreds of hacks and scams before. \n\nThe first major Solana hack, and less than 24 hours later the institutions propping up solana claim they are bailing everyone out. If this is not the least bit suspicious to you, then you are just being slow boiled alive. \n\nSolana itself is a long term pump and dump that is devoid of any decentralisation and fundamentals except a bunch of whales propping it up. The tokenomics of every single Solana \"ecosystem\" project is puke worthy - from Serum to Raydium, Bonfida, Saber etc all have massive supply in the hands of a few, an incredibly high FDV and a low float and funny unlock mechanisms - perfect conditions for institutions to keep dumping on hapless retail investors like the ones supporting Solana in the comments here who dont understand anything about crypto or finance.",

Last night several threads warned about Trezor phishing scam and almost on cue, today I read a post by 7 year crypto veteran that he fell for it and lost everything, about $72,000 in Bitcoin.\n\nIt can happen to anyone. You're tired, arguing with your gf, distracted, etc... nobody is perfect. He lost everything. I can't afford that. Shit gives me nightmares.\n\nI've been intending to buy a Trezor for some time now, but I keep hesitating. I've been so nervous about the whole thing. What if I lose my seed phrase? I live n NYC, someone breaks into my apartment, a fire, collapse, etc.. call me paranoid.\n\nNow that Coinbase One offers insurance, I'm not even going to worry about cold storage. I sleep better this way. I don't care about all the \"not your keys not your coins\" arguments. I have a legally enforceable contract with Coinbase now that I pay for.\n\nTrue, it's price is kinda steep at $30 a month, but to me it's worth it. It comes with no trading fees which sweetens the pie. Also comes with \"priority\" customer support, which I tested and only had to wait 2 minutes before I was speaking to a live agent.\n\nSo yeah, fuck that. I'm just too paranoid. If US gov ever looks like it's on the verge of collapse, then yeah, I might put it in cold storage before I bounce out of the country.

    "postText": "So... are we going to ignore that TRON (TRX), with 7.5 BILLION market cap, is pretty much following LUNA's footsteps? [TRON (TRX) is currently the #14 coin by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/). The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.\n\nTRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). The algorithm governing the stablecoin\u2019s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron's network\u2019s native token. *Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can't put my finger on it....*\n\nNow here's this week's best offer! [You can earn up to 57% through sun.io's LP!](https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH) What a great deal.\n\nAccording to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins) USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on **May 5, 2022**. *Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...*\n\nOh and we haven't even checked the **project's founder, Justin Sun.**\n\nLet's get started:\n\nJustin Sun launched TRON's whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China's ban on ICO's. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been **tipped off by Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.** Does this also sound familiar....? \n\nOn top of that. [it's been also reported that he copy pasted the project's whitepaper from another coin](https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/). This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called \"algorithmic stablecoin\" is a scam waiting to collapse.\n\nIt is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.\n\nOn top of all that, it's been reported that:\n\n* He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.\n\n* He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.\n\n* It's been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects' Co-Founder Vitalik.\n\n[You can read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)\n\nSo, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. \n\nMy hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.\n\nEdit: [So I guess news sites are now copy pasting our posts?](https://news.coincu.com/94161-tron-trx-with-7-5-billion-market-cap-is-pretty-much-following-lunas-footsteps/)",

I just came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/opv7xz/warning_whales_are_manipulating_us_all_yesterdays/) warning people of whale manipulation, but this person is not showing you the full picture.\n\nThe [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/op6xvs/bitcoin_will_reach_75k_in_september_heres_how/) provided an excellent stegosauric analysis and predicted a price of $75k in September, as shown below:\n\n[Stegosaurus Under a Rainbow \\(SUR\\) pattern](https://preview.redd.it/ttphvgobcxc71.png?width=2709&format=png&auto=webp&s=225c7e14b35c5d48f330a213a7141ed28d9f61ac)\n\nThen a user by the name of Chance Underscore Waters (is that even your real name?) came along and made a post about how the SUR pattern is BS, instead opting for the Bart Simpson skateboard market pattern:\n\n[False skateboard market \\\\\"prediction\\\\\" pushed by a blue whale](https://preview.redd.it/dm5ux1jdcxc71.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=311b2692de973cc20498220fda26a092612b6f2d)\n\nThey equated this to the tulip mania, but forgot one important thing: Bart Simpson's initials spell out BS. You see, the whale showed you a zoomed in chart so you would dump your coins, leaving them cheap for whales to swoop in and take. **THIS** is the market manipulation they \"warned\" you about.\n\nWhat they didn't tell you about is the tried-and-true Half-Pipe Valuation strategy or HPV. Gross. Anyone that played even a minute of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater knows that the real money is in the half-pipes. I've rewired my GPUs to calculate the direction of the market and it produced the following chart:\n\n[Half-Pipe Valuation \\(HPV\\) strategy](https://preview.redd.it/axf9tyhfcxc71.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=41d67966cfa702f1a3b37ddcc5fe670d148541f8)\n\nIn conclusion, the SUR pattern still holds and is even conservative by some estimates (my estimate). The original poster was not a whale at all but a dolphin trying to help. We owe them an apology.\n\nEdit: the gigawhale has [responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/opxkqv/double_warning_the_person_warning_you_of_whale/h6995od?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) without denying he is jeff bezos",

    "postText": "Crypto scammer got in touch with me. He didn't know I used to be a scambaiter. It didn't end well for him. I had often heard that if you mention you are new to crypto, lots of scammers will DM you and offer to trade for you. But the thing is, I hadn't received any of those DMs so far, and I was looking forward to, because I was once a scambaiter and I missed the good old days.\n\nWell, this \"crypto trader\" contacted me out of the blue three weeks ago, and I happened to have some free time in my hands. He stole the pictures of some real guy who works with blockchain technologies. He really wanted to talk about crypto, but I tried to deviate from this topic and tried to flirt with him instead. I provided some fake info about myself, and acted like I was very lonely and very happy to finally talk to someone. I wanted to waste his time, but he kept asking about crypto.\n\nDay by day, I tried to gain his trust. I acted very naive and grateful for his advice. I even told him someone had DM'ed me to discuss crypto, and that I suspected it could be a scam. He instructed me to block those people as soon as possible. One day, I asked to do a voice call, but he couldn't because apparently that would disrupt his crypto signals, whatever that means. He claimed to be from the US, which I'm sure he wasn't, judging by the way he expressed himself.\n\nHe wanted my crypto asap. He was going to trade it for free because he loves me so much. I told him I was going to receive an inheritance in crypto, but that my attorney was the one managing it. I asked whether I should tell the attorney about our \"relationship\" and how he was going to trade for me. He ordered me not to tell anyone about \"us\". Unfortunately for the scammer, the \"attorney\" would be back around the second week of September. This bought me some extra time to keep wasting his.\n\nI never thought I would end up pulling this off, but what I did has all the characteristics of an advance-fee scam:\n\n1. The \"attorney\", who was the custodian of my crypto inheritance, told me he was holding 2.74 BTC on my behalf.\n2. I went to see the attorney and signed some documents, where I gave him permission to transfer all my crypto to the scammer. I gave scammer a made-up case id and asked him to contact the attorney.\n3. Scammer contacted the attorney but didn't provide the id. This delayed things (also because I was busy in real life). Id was requested again.\n4. Scammer provided the id and his address for the transfer to take place.\n5. Attoney informed scammer that, to avoid scams, and to pay for administration costs, he would have to transfer 0.05% fee in advance (0.00137 BTC).\n6. I woke up to a formerly empty wallet that now contains the 0.00137 BTC, I couldn't believe it! This is [the transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/d5a2c2c2802c9e2d630c51cbf62450155cf6263067f586a96650777910b8a3a4).\n\nNow, I have this weird feeling, because I hold BTC that might have been stolen from someone else. I might hold it for a few months and then donate it to the food bank or something, I don't know. At least I hope he learned a lesson and will devote his time to something other than scamming people.\n\nHere are some images with the highlights of our 3 weeks of interaction:  [https://imgur.com/a/mnFJhj1](https://imgur.com/a/mnFJhj1)\n\nBy the way, Reddit does not allow you to report a profile, all I could do was report the pictures he stole from someone else, and I also warned that someone else.\n\nEdit:  After getting the fees, the attorney told him that his activity was suspicious so the fees had been frozen and he was going to be investigated for fraud and impersonation.\n\nHours later, I messaged him as myself telling him the attorney had called me  and that he had found out he was a scammer. I said I couldn't believe he had betrayed me like that! The last thing he said was that he loved me.\n\nEdit2: Thanks everyone for all the love! I don't think I am able to answer to every single message individually at this point, but thanks so much again! ",

Here's my flawless Technical Analysis: Edit: I just want to say a HUGE thanks to everyone who gave me an award... there's a lot of them!\n\nLove you all so much  **\ud83d\ude0e** \n\n\\-------------\n\nHi everyone, Nutty Joe here with another epic post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of us know how much longer the bull market is going to last, nor if we will reach the previous All Time Highs seen in May. However, having completed extensive research in the last few days, I can tell you with complete confidence that **the bull market will continue through to New Years, and beyond!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI present to you three points that confirm my theory:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Bitcoin will hit $100k in 2021\n2. Bullish investors outnumber Bears\n3. Warren Buffet told me ***personally*** that the Bullrun will go through to 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**----- 1. Bitcoin will hit $100k -----**\n\nFigure 1 indicates BTC\u2019s path from August 2020 to August 2021 (present), represented by the Blue Line.\n\nThe Red Line indicates Bitcoin\u2019s path to $100k for the rest of the year. This has been determined based on ***weeks*** of research I have performed (which I will not bother to explain as I am too tired; just take my word for it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 1. The Red Line indicates Bitcoin's price change from August 2021 to New Year's. As you can see, we will easily hit $100k by then!](https://preview.redd.it/fkw7kqclq3i71.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6907991d3c7cf62fbb8d571636707d51be781ab)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is irrefutable evidence isn\u2019t it! What a great analyser I am. Bitcoin to $100k by the end of the year is a certainty, and therefore indicates the Bullrun will continue on strongly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**----- 2. Bullish investors outnumber Bears -----**\n\nThis part requires very complex calculations. I have mathematically determined that there are more Bullish investors than Bearish, through an extensive algorithm.\n\nThis sub has 3.3 million members; all of these people are hopeful that the Bull Market will continue on to 2022. Dividing this number by the current population of Earth, 7.9 billion, gives us Figure 2:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 2. Don't worry if these calculations are too confusing. Maths can be hard!](https://preview.redd.it/oyi2v7lyq3i71.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=9548bf7d53008e1ef8dc7bbc3cdce9a779fe3246)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom this, we can see that 42% of people in the world are bullish on crypto. That\u2019s nearly half of ***everyone alive***! Therefore, we can safely guarantee that there are more Bulls than Bears currently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**----- 3. Warren Buffet confirms the Bullrun will last until 2022 -----**\n\nI managed to get a hold of Mr Buffet, a famed investor and long-term supporter of money. I sent him the following message:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 3. Thank you Mr Buffet for contributing to my epic research!](https://preview.redd.it/ggltrxcbr3i71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4646370386ff173d522c9526b645d501fbc790)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAstonishing! Warren Buffet believes the Bullrun is going into next year. He is one of the richest people alive: therefore we must take his word for it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**----- Summary -----**\n\nThanks to my excellent research, I have determined with 99.7% accuracy that **the Bullrun will continue into 2022.** Please trust me on this: would I ever lie to you good people?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.

    "postText": "Speculation on why the dump (and rebound) happened today, and what's to come.  This is purely speculation. Some of this will be talking about the world  outside of cryptos - specifically other markets, equities, and a bigger picture. If that's not allowed on this subreddit, totally understood, but I thought I'd bring an outsiders perspective to this, since I am utterly unsurprised by the events of the day and have been expecting this (or something like it) for some time. \n\nThis is not meant as financial advice. Do your own research. Make your  own decisions. If you think I\u2019m right, great! Act on it. If you think  I\u2019m wrong, great! Act on it. Do your own thing. I'm just some guy on the internet, and my opinions are about as valuable as a guy spinning a sign on a street corner.\n\nFinally, this is not intended as a FUD post - if you come to  the same conclusions I have, there will certainly be fear involved, but hopefully no uncertainty or doubt, and you can make decisions that lead to healthy financial outcomes for yourselves and loved ones. I\u2019d  like to post a TLDR that everything is going to be okay at the end, but I  don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s going to be the case. I think scary and volatile times lay in our immediate future. I have no crystal ball, and whether that's tomorrow or 3 months from now I don't know, but I think we're facing choppy seas. \n\nI believe we're about to see a major market correction, and the volatility in cryptocurrencies is just the beginning. I believe this will hit every sector of the economy, from housing prices to the value of the USD. I believe cryptocurrencies in particular will see extreme volatility, both in a downward trajectory and later, an upward trajectory. \n\nHere are some core premises this speculation will be based on. \n\n1. Cryptocurrencies have not yet found a price equilibrium that reflects  their ultimate value. Currently, they are a speculative asset.\n\n2. Despite not having to file their positions on their 13F forms, hedge  funds and investment banks are very much involved in cryptos.\n\n3. Cryptos are a relatively unregulated market, which makes pump and dumps a much easier prospect. \n\n4. In their current form, cryptos have not achieved any real detachment  from the US dollar. Meaning, that when the market goes up, cryptos go  up, and when the market goes down, so do cryptos. Their promise of  breaking from the USD an becoming an intrinsically stable currency appears to not have matured  for the moment. \n\nHere are some ancillary premises. \n\n1. In order to shore up the economy during covid, the government did a  few things: it started loaning money at 0% interest like crazy, and it  reduced collateral requirements to increase liquidity in the  marketplace.\n\n2. Collateral is heavily rehypothicated right now. An example of this  goes as follows: company A has a 20 year treasury bond. It\u2019s keeping it  on its books as collateral to meet its margin requirements so that a lender will give it money to invest on margin. Company A then proceeds to lend  that treasury bond to company B. Company A keeps it on its books though, because  they can recall it as collateral any time they need to in order to meet their own collateral requirements. B now goes to  a lender and says \u201chey, I have this treasury bond as collateral,  will you lend me some money?\u201d This process is repeated several times, until you eventually have an absolutely massive amount of margin being lent out on a single treasury bond serving as collateral. Go take a peak at the repo market. People are literally paying borrow US Treasuries to hold as collateral because collateral has been so overleveraged. \n\n3. During Covid, the economy has suffered. unemployment is up, supply chains have been stressed, companies have been going out of business, and savings have actually gone up for the lucky people who have been able to hang on to their jobs, and they're not out spending money. This has lead to an abnormal situation in which the stock market, which is typically (at least loosely) tied to the economy and goes up or down in tandem with the economy as a whole disconnecting - meaning that while the economy is doing poorly, the stock market has boomed to a new ATH at an unprecedented rate. \n\n4. Margin debt in the financial markets has seen an enormous spike in the last year. The market as a whole is extremely leveraged - which means that small events can have enormous impacts, and wider market implications. \n\nAnd finally, here are some more speculative premises. These concern what I believe is, and will be the catalyst, and the hope for crypto in the future, but they're not essential for the argument that the market correction is imminent. \n\n \n\n1. Naked short selling is an enormous problem facing the US financial markets. To understand why, it's important to understand the difference between short selling (locating and borrowing a share, selling it, and promising to buy it back later on the hopes of a lower price), and naked short selling (creating a synthetic share that was never issued by the original company and selling it). \n2. Naked short selling has long seen lax oversight by the regulatory agencies. Through a series of revolving doors and allowing the markets to run their own regulatory agencies, this enormously profitable business gets a blind eye from the regulators tasked with stopping it, because those same regulators are ultimately also the ones who profit from it when they move back into the private industry. \n3. Naked short selling is the financial equivalent of creating a counterfeit share, selling it for profit at the cost to the shareholders and company, and having 0 intention of paying it back. This tanks company value, and effectively steals value from actual shareholders. It has been used for decades to drive companies out of business. Occasionally, you get a company like Overstock that beats the odds and sees a short squeeze followed by a share price resurgence, but it frequently results in a company going out of business. \n4. Naked short selling can be hidden in a variety of ways. While people frequently turn to the short interest as a way to examine how shorted a company is, there are a variety of methods that market makers can employ using options chains to create FTD's (shares that are a failure to deliver because they never had them in the first place, and never intended to find) and then recycling those FTD's ad-infinitum until the targeted company goes bust.  \n5. When Covid hit, several hedge funds, banks, and market makers decided which companies they were going to short into oblivion, and profit off of their demise. They picked companies that would in theory be particularly hard hit by a reduction in customers that were used to entering a physical location.  \n6. For many companies, those efforts failed. The companies did not go out of business, and these Hedge funds and market makers find themselves in a position where they cannot close their positions, they are losing money every day. The two most well known companies in this position are AMC and GME. \n7. Shorting a company exposes the short position to infinite loss. \n8. There has never been a perfect storm of a short squeeze as GME. AMC may squeeze to a lesser extent - but it has no where near the amount of shorts that GME does. \n9. There are a variety of catalysts that can cause GME and AMC to squeeze. Contrary to common opinion, the surge in share price in January and February was due to what's called a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze, and the shorts have not covered.   \n\n\nWhich brings us up to today. I believe that multiple hedge funds and market makers are in very deep on their short positions, and that they are fighting on a day by day basis at this point to stay solvent. I believe that if the US financial market is the overloaded and unstable Jenga tower, these companies are the live hand grenade placed on top of the tower, and have had the pin pulled.   \n\n\nHowever, whether or not they're the catalyst is relatively unimportant in the overall picture - the markets are over leveraged on crazy high margin right now either way. There was a liquidity test last week, and the results were not published, but the markets have been...sketchy at best since then. Because of how over leveraged the market is, I believe that virtually any hedge fund that gets margin called is too big too fail, because it's walking on that much of a knifes edge. And when it comes down, it's going to take everything down with it, from the real estate market (both commercial and residential). I believe that speculative assets in tech and crypto are going to be particularly hard hit. The house of cards is staggering like a drunk man that just got hit in the head, and doesn't know that he's bleeding internally and about to die of an aneurysm.   \n\n\nSo why did Crypto across the board see such a huge (and similar across different currencies) dip followed by a massive rebound? Because as a largely unregulated asset, it's extremely ripe for pump and dumps. Hedge funds can use it to inflate their assets on paper and get access to margin.   \n\n\nAnd I believe that yesterday they got margin called. GME has been sitting above what the speculated margin call price should be for a day or two now (although nobody is certain what the exact price is at the moment, the speculation is between 170-180) and their lenders were demanding better collateral than the crypto they had on their books. When you get margin called, you have some time to come up with the required collateral before it's considered a default and your broker starts liquidating your positions. I believe they met their margin requirements this morning, managed to hold off default for another day, and immediately started pumping crypto again. They simultaneously shorted GME down and dropped the price from $180 to $165, thus probably lowering their margin requirements as well.   \n\n\nAgain, I can't stress this enough: while I believe that GME and the hedge funds and market makers massive short position is involved, the argument that a bunch of hedge funds got margin called yesterday is not dependent on that - the market has been dipping the past few days, and it could simply be a matter of being over leveraged and seeing a few red days in the market that caused a margin call. All of the people all over the world that have been buying GME at unprecedented rates for the past 4 months could be totally wrong. But even if they are, this crypto dump still has the looks of a margin call. Both BTC and ETH have dropped over 50% from their ATH this morning before the rebound. The timing of hitting their low points 3 minutes before OCC-007 (which raises collateral requirements for the month) came into effect seems telling to me that somebody was really close to going under.   \n\n\nAnd I believe that this is the first of many margin calls, and eventually, somebody is going to default, and the dominos will begin to fall, leading to a massive market correction (or collapse, depending on how you want to look at it) that leaves everybody hurting bad.   \n\n\nWhat happens next, and how I personally plan to respond is more up in the air. The Fed can respond to this in a variety of ways. They can opt to fire up the printer and start devaluing our currency to try and buy our way out of debt with a worthless USD, or they can opt to embrace the pain and raise interest rates and create a few decades of pain and stagnation while we dig our way out of a deep depression through long term austerity. Whether or not I (and everybody else betting on the GME thesis) are right will also play a big role in what happens next. If we are correct, it's going to create what is essentially a black hole for liquidity in the markets, as money flows out of the hands of the wealthy and leaves big reliable blue chip companies, and moves into the hands of GME holders. If that's the case, money is going to be flowing into the hands of people who have a deep, deep distrust of the US financial system and the regulatory agencies, and I anticipate a massive boom in crypto's as people look for places to store their money outside of US financial market control. If my speculation is correct, we'll see bitcoin hit the teens (or maybe even single digits) before they begin to climb back up, and we'll eventually see surging and setting new ATH's in the near future afterwards, and a similar story for ETH. I'm less certain about the less well known coins - my assumption is that they will not see nearly as much of a rebound as BTC and ETH, but who knows.   \n\n\nIf the GME thesis is not correct, but the economy does crash and the fed Fed fires up the printer, I still anticipate a huge rebound in crypto - it is, afterall, still ripe for pump and dumps, and at the end of the day, it is in theory a pretty good place to store value in an inflation resistant location.   \n\n\nIf the Fed opts to raise interest rates and embrace deflation over at the opposite end of the spectrum though, than cash will be king and crypto will be utterly screwed for the next 5-10 years I'd bet. If hyper inflation is a great way of turning a Weimar Republic into a Nazi Germany, deflation and austerity are a great way of turning into Greece. Neither are great options though. Hopefully some smarter people can come up with something better.    \n\n\nTLDR: If the market crashes, which is very likely, Crypto is set to take an enormous dip with it. Every hedge fund that's dipped its toes in is going to dump it like a hot potato, and if you thought it dipped fast this morning when it dropped over 20% in an hour, what comes next will make your head spin. But for now, they met their margin call and live to fight another day. Eventually though, somebody is going to trip and the economy is going down with them. And when that happens the Fed will be forced to embrace either inflation or deflation, and I expect Crypto to rebound if they choose inflation. Additionally, if the theory of GME turns out to be correct, there's going to be quite a few new millionaires with money burning a hole in their pocket to be spent, and they'll be looking for speculative inflation resistant assets that are not subject to corrupt US regulatory agencies. There's always the possibility that over the next few months, companies slowly manage to deleverage and increase their collateral without causing a market wide panic for the exits, and simultaneously the GME theory of everything is wrong, and the markets continue largely as they have been now.   \n\n\nWhatever the case, I believe it's going to be a bumpy ride with more volatility in the near future, and I wish all of you the best. Good luck to everybody.",

    "postText": "If you're still thinking about cryptocurrency as being only about currency, you haven't had the \"aha\" moment that's coming. It's like thinking of cellphones as being purely about phone calls (circa 2004) and not understanding the potential of smart phones. You hear a lot of a certain breed of maxi being very dismissive of smart contracts.  It's the 2004 equivalent of saying, \"okay, but so what?  I can play a glorified version of 'snake' on an iPhone.  Nokia still has market dominance.\"\n\nThe full picture of what it means to make a blockchain a turing-complete computer is beyond all our imaginations.  It's not a single feature.  It's the millions of yet-to-be-invented applications that will change the world.  \n\nWhen smart phones first came around, there wasn't all that much to \"do\" with them either.  The first real \"killer app\" of the smart phone market was email.  The idea of combining it with our phone was so handy it couldn't be denied.  And we already have our first killer app of smart contract platforms: DeFi.    The benefit of getting yield on your crypto is undeniable.  It's also clunky still, but that'll change.  The interfaces will get smoother, simpler, and less confusing.  And after DeFi, it'll be the next thing then the next, then the next.  Metaverse?  Decentralized Web?  Who knows.  But the point is it's coming.\n\nYou hear people argue, \"but that isn't the *point* of cryptocurrency.  The *point* is to be a currency.\"  Technology doesn't care what things started as.  Is there anyone left whose primary use of their cellphone is to make phone calls?",

    "postText": "No one seems to actually know what a smart contract is, yet are trying to explain them. Here's the actual explanation of what they are. Smart contracts do not ensure payments went through, and they do not create decentralized casinos or banks.  In fact, they offer no guarantees about decentralization whatsoever.\n\nThey CAN be used for these things, but what they really are is much simpler.\n\nSmart contracts are immutable scripts that exist on the blockchain.  They maintain a state (i.e. they store data) and they have functions that can be called.  That's it.\n\nThe only way to interact with a smart contract is to call one of its functions.  There are read-only functions that can be called on any Ethereum node to read some data out of the contract, and then there are functions you can call that modify data in some way, but those require sending a transaction and paying gas.\n\nYou can use this functionality to do many things, but it is important to note that they do NOT ensure anything.  You can write backdoors into smart contracts.  Smart contracts can have admins that have the ability to yoink all the funds out of it.  There are categories of bugs that allow a malicious smart contract to attack other smart contracts if they can get that contract to call one of their functions.  \n\nLike all code, smart contracts can be written poorly or well.  The guarantees come from the implementation, not the nature of smart contracts themselves.  The same is true for banking software or other non-blockchain apps.\n\nThe key difference is that the code for smart contracts is (mostly) immutable.  Once they are deployed, the code cannot be changed.  However, there are some exceptions to note:\n\n* Smart contracts can be written so that they are destroyed by calling a destructor function.  After that, the contract becomes invalid and can't be interacted with\n* A smart contract can be modular and call other smart contracts.  You can \"upgrade\" one smart contract by deploying a new modular component and pointing the old contract to the new one with updated functionality.\n\nDon't get caught up thinking that smart contracts are some amazing thing that solves all of our problems when it comes to creating safe, verified transactions.  They are just code, that's it.   People can still write shitty code.\n\nEDIT: As others have pointed out, I'm speaking specifically about Ethereum smart contracts.  Other blockchains could have smart contracts with different properties, but I imagine they would be mostly similar.",

    "postText": "Proof that Bitboy Crypto Pumps and Dumps on his subscribers. So yeah, once again, fuck you Bitboy Crypto and other Youtubers. There was a great post on this subreddit yesterday, talking about Youtubers destroying beginners in the crypto space, and I couldn't agree more with that post. ([Link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mc60c0/to_bitboy_crypto_and_related_youtube_clickbaiters/))\n\nI get constant recommendations in my Youtube of this clickbaity fuckers, even though I have selected \"Don't show anymore\" on Youtube, but I guess it doesn't care. And lucky me...because Bitboy has released a video titled: \"My $10 Million Crypto Portfolio REVEALED (Shocking Holdings)\".\n\nFirst of all, there is nothing shocking in your holdings, besides the amount of coins that you have already accepted a sponsor of and didn't disclose it, which is illegal.\n\nAnd this got me thinking of some coins that he has proclaimed that have a \"100x\" potential, so I decided to watch the video, and see if he puts his money where is mouth is. (I only know where he puts his mouth in for those thumbnails)\n\nWell Lo and Behold...that must be one of the biggest self exposes I have seen in a while.\n\nHe has SEVERAL videos titled something similar to: \"BEST Low Cap Crypto Gem of 2021\", and GUESS WHAT!! He doesn't hold 2/10 coins that he pumps in those videos. But he does hold 300k USD...hmmm, where has that come from?\n\nI know that one of his sponsored videos was about SOUL, where he named it the BEST LOW CAP GEM, and HE DOESN'T OWN IT. This is more than proof that he dumps soon after his video airs.\n\nFrontier...same thing...naming it the coin with the best potential he has seen, and it is only 0.4% of his portfolio??? Yeah right. See it for yourself if you are interested...\n\nJust wanted to leave this information here. THIS IS PROOF THAT WHOEVER LISTENS TO BITBOY CRYPTO IS BEING SCAMMED. And if he was investigated...oh boy...oh boy, he would certainly use that \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude2e face quite a bit in jail.",

From the data we have, many of his recommendations are profitable in the short term (usually a couple of months). However, Coin Bureau hasn't been around for long enough to prove that he can pick out good long term projects (at least a few years). Overall, I think the data shows that if you want to diversify into alts, Coin Bureau's recommendations are generally a decent choice if you're too lazy or don't have the time to DYOR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR\n\nCoin Bureau's recommendations are generally profitable in the short term (usually a couple of months). However, one year's worth of data really isn't that much, and I think you should always have more in BTC and ETH than in any of these recommendations combined.\n\n\nEdit: I wrongly stated that Secret Network did not outperform BTC or ETH.

It had several famous devs involved and they managed to collect 13000 ETH or $60million aprox, they rugged everyone taking all the funds out of the contract. And now inside that team they are pointing fingers between each other and no one knows where the funds are. This happened 3-2 days ago.\n\nWhat surprises me is that this was a rug where famous devs have been involved and no one is talking about. \"DYOR\" \"you should put your money on people that has been proved right before\" \"trust on respetable people, not on randoms\" etc etc...in this case it has also been proven wrong, and 30 times the amount of SquidDao have been stolen.\n\nCrypto is a dangerous space, random projects that tells you in your face that you cannot sell your funds (basically telling you I'm gonna steal from you), or others that seem like a good bet but they fk you up anyways.\n\nStay safu.",

And today I noticed on the homepage that I reached 1 million trackers and ads blocked, which is pretty shocking. Additionally, I was essentially PAID to browse as I normally would -- with the recent run up in the price of BAT this amounts to \\~$165. Obviously not a significant amount of money, but I think the concept is awesome regardless.\n\nThe browser itself works well, and the only issues I have with it are:\n\n* You can only \"cash out\" via an Uphold wallet, which is KYC and has high fees.\n* Some issues with receiving BAT payments on time.\n* Can't enable BAT rewards on my iPhone, due to Apple's policy.\n\nTo those of you on the fence, I would suggest at least trying Brave. You can enable / disable BAT rewards (to earn BAT there are some pop-up ads that appear) as you please, so there's really no downside to giving it a shot. I think there are decent arguments on both sides about the value of the BAT token, so you can determine for yourself if enabling BAT ads are \"worth it\" for you.\n\n[Brave\\/BAT Summary](https://preview.redd.it/p9owsa5d9no61.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6164b213a07c39ccd5915c247cd2972a26ea4e2)",

Let's have a look:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&s=79de6ff34018315c748a2e743caef0ca3b277c65\n\n**There was no bear market. There was a relatively small crash in 2020 as everyone panicked over Covid. That's not a bear market. This picture also shows you that it's even worse, the market has been absolutely parabolic for almost 2 years.** \n\nThat's the S&P 500 index. Notice something? Every ten years or so there's a severe downward correction which lasts 1-2 years. In the early 2000s it was the tech bubble, in 2008/9 it was the mortgage crisis. As you can see here, we've been in a sharp uptrend for over 10 years now. This uptrend has been fueled not in small part by record low interest rates. This is turn has resulted in parts of the market being hopelessly overvalued, a prime example being Tesla.\n\nNow look at the crypto charts, specifically the top 50 alts. Most of them have had absolutely face melting pumps over the last 18 months. Do you think that's just going to keep going up? Their valuations are now so ridiculous that 'crypto market caps' are basically a meme, completely detached from reality. Of course market caps are hardly ever a true reflection of what company is worth, but they are a reflection of the amount of speculation in the current market. Just to look at a few:\n\nCardano MC $36 billion, doesn't have fully functional smart contracts, lots of promises while continually underdelivering, if at all.\n\nSolana: MC $30 billion, has been unusable for the last 48 hours, has suffered multiple outages over the last 6 months which lasted up to 17 hours.\n\nDogecoin: $18 billion MC....don't think I need to go into more detail on this one.\n\nEthereum: $288 billion market cap, supposed to disrupt the global banking industry (along with everything else), meanwhile it costs $200 for a simple ERC20 token swap.\n\nBTC: $665 billion market cap, supposed to be the future of digital store of value, meanwhile, has lost more than 50% in value over the course of 2.5 months.\n\netc....\n\nThe point is that these market caps aren't a reflection of the current states of those projects, but rather their promised states at some future point in time. Unless that point in time is very close as in a few months away, that's not sustainable. I personally don't think that point in time is very close, as almost nothing in crypto currency works as advertised.\n\n**What would a multi year global bear market mean for crypto?**\n\n\\- BTC bleeds more than stock market\n\n\\- ETH bleeds more than BTC\n\n\\- Alts will bleed even heavier than ETH and a good number will never recover. You have to remember something very basic here: if an alt your holding loses 90% of its value in the bear market, it has to pull a 10X just to get back to its previous price.\n\n**Further complication:**\n\nDCAing into projects is obviously the way to go in a bear market, but it becomes more difficult to predict what projects will have merit the longer the bear market continues. Will your favourite project still be relevant in 2024 or will it be replaced by something that hasn't even launched and won't until 2023? The longer the bear market lasts, the more likely that outcome becomes. Do lots of research, try to keep up with the tech developments in crypto. The next Solana or Luna is probably being planned as I write this. Try to find it.",

As many of you know, Robinhood is launching [cryptocurrency wallets](https://news.bitcoin.com/trading-platform-robinhood-launch-cryptocurrency-wallets/) soon.\n\nYou also may be familiar with the fact that on January 28, 2021, Robinhood infamously [restricted the trading of various stocks](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/), making positions close-only. \n\nLastly, anyone who has used the platform for trading cryptocurrency is likely familiar with the \"scheduled maintenance\" that conveniently obstructs you from making trades at times when the market is making a significant movement. \n\nStill, I know that many people are too complacent for their own good; they will be fully aware of Robinhood's corruption, but they will use the platform anyways for the commission-free trading. This brings us to our next point...\n\n# Are there actually no fees on Robinhood trades?\n\nShort answer: no.\n\nWhen you buy cryptocurrency, Robinhood makes money on the artificially wide bid-ask spread. What this means for you is that Robinhood will try to make you pay more when you buy crypto, and try to offer you less when you go to sell your crypto.\n\nJust for demonstrative purposes: lets say you are trying to buy 1 BTC. Robinhood might tell you that the price is $50,000. Then, they will pair you up with someone who is selling 1 BTC for $49,990, and pocket the $10 difference. \n\nStill confused? This analogy may help:\n\n>Intentionally quoting a trader a higher price so you can make money on a greater bid-ask spread is akin to shopping mall outlets raising their prices before running a steep \u201cdiscount\u201d to lure customers.\u00a0 \n\n[\\[source\\]](https://coincentral.com/zero-fee-crypto-trading/)\n\nSo please, even if you aren't concerned about Robinhood's trading restrictions and shady management, you should be aware of the way that they profit off of your cryptocurrency trades. **They still charge you a fee, it is just hidden. Since you know that fees are inevitable, you should choose a more reputable and reliable cryptocurrency broker to do business with.**",

    "postText": "Finally did it: I made a crypto trading bot that automatically places orders on new listings before they get added on Binance So I've been working on this project for about 2 months now, and I've learned quite a bit about how new listings behave, and how important the Binance Annoucement page is.\n\nMy inital idea was to create a crypto trading bot in Python, that constantly checks if a new listing is added on Binance, essentially by checking the total number of coins at any given time. I tried out different variations on this, end even increased the speed to buy within 0.1 seconds on a new coin being listed.\n\nAfter looking at the results, and talking to some of you on here, it turns out that the spike in the price upon listing the coin is actually the peak of the iceberg.\n\nThe real activity seems to happen once Binance Announces that they will list the coin, and not upon the listing itself.\n\nHave a look at the chart for FIDA/USDT below, and the time Binance made the announcement:\n\n[FIDAUSDT](https://preview.redd.it/q6bnt5noynu71.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b370c7cf601c57bf2c5cf19ffb9df8c6730d117)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/689yka0rynu71.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=f70c90a371a9bddecf298ba6ec42837f8570485a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooks like people are fomoing hard into new coins on different exchanges in anticipation of a Binance pump, ironically creating the pump themselves.\n\nSo with that in mind, I built a crypto trading algorithm that listens to the Binance announcement page, and once there is an announcement for a new coin listing, the bot extracts the symbol of that coin and places a Buy order on Gate .io.\n\nThe tool will automatically place buy and sell orders and it has a trailing stop loss feature, meaning that it should sell at the optimum time, in theory.\n\nI chose gate .io because according to what I've seen and what some of you have said, this exchange seem to list many of the coins that later make it on Binance or other bigger exchanges.\n\nThe tool is free to use for everyone, but I suggest running it in Test mode at first, as I still need to confirm that everything runs fine. Annoyingly, gate .io doesn't have a testnet which means I had to test the buy/sell logic by placing real trades - not ideal.\n\nBut I've included a test mode for the tool itself, so it won't actually call the gate .io API, it will just simulate the trades locally.\n\nI'm currently waiting for new annoucements to test out the profitability and will report back. For anyone interested in the project or who may want to test this out themselves:\n\n**Here's a video overview of the tool and why it evolved to this:** [**https://youtu.be/SsSgD0v16Kg**](https://youtu.be/SsSgD0v16Kg)\n\n**A guide on how to install and run this on your machine:** [**https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/**](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/)\n\n**And of course, the source code on GitHub:** [**https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/gateio-crypto-trading-bot-binance-announcements-new-coins**](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/gateio-crypto-trading-bot-binance-announcements-new-coins)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you wish to talk trading bots, join me here:**  [https://discord.gg/Ga56KXUUNn](https://discord.gg/Ga56KXUUNn)\n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: congrats on your gains to all hodlers today :)",

So it would appear our money is gone, because our balances are zero.  We\u2019ve all opened tickets with support with absolutely no responses, posted on their subreddit, and called to only be on hold for hours without any help. I really don\u2019t know what else to do except try to get us on the front page of a bigger crypto community.\n\nMore details about this issue are here https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/7mx88o/urgent_coinbase_to_gdax_transfer_disappeared/?st=JBUBPP35&sh=a19f1463\n\nThank you so much for your help to anybody who can spare an upvote to bring some attention to this.\n\nIf anybody from Coinbase finally wants to help, my support ticket number is 3221822\n\nUPDATE: there\u2019s a comment response from the Coinbase CEO, saying they\u2019ll get to our tickets. Since I doubt they\u2019ll respond again to me (and my balance is still 0 on GDAX so basically this whole issue was still not enough to fix our problem) - here\u2019s my response:\n\nWhat proof do I have that my coins are not lost? My balance on GDAX is 0, and my LTC balance on Coinbase is 0. This kind of thing should be a priority issue if people are getting balances of 0 on GDAX with an automatic send to their wallet transfer from Coinbase to GDAX like this. I\u2019m even more frustrated that with 3.5k upvotes and a response, my LTC balance is still 0 from an error on their side.\n\nOne last clarification: I do not have any pending transfer issues (these I\u2019m familiar with an have learned to wait). The transaction on the blockchain finished, the funds even appeared in my Coinbase account. The automatic transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (which has happened at least 5-10 times with no issues for me) this time withdrew the money from my Coinbase account and said the deposit to GDAX was completed. But my balance is 0 for LTC on Coinbase and 0 on GDAX, so this last move to GDAX (which is supposed to be instant, and says completed) zeroed my LTC balance. My balance has been 0 LTC for over 3 days now. This has nothing to do with their wire transfers, although I really feel for everyone still waiting on their withdrawals and hope they resolve that soon.\n\nUPDATE: it\u2019s been 4 days and still missing all of my LTC\n\nUPDATE: 5 days now. No more holidays. I have no faith in crypto exchanges anymore.\n\n6 days now. What a joke. I\u2019ll post the next update in 6 months when my support ticket gets addressed and if I\u2019m lucky they\u2019ll fix our problem.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: Fixed finally after 6 and a half days.  My account has been transferred the litecoin that were missing, thank you so much everyone on reddit for bringing attention to this. I really owe everyone because I had no power at all over this situation and I like to think this post helped get Coinbase to at least address this issue. It would appear others are still having problems with this Coinbase to GDAX transfer, or at least haven\u2019t had their missing coins returned yet, just as an FYI.

I did actualyl debunk him last month, but then realised he isnt having honest debates but is just putting out propaganda. Given that he isnt acting in good faith, and is a buttcoiner, kinda pointless for me to debunk moreover, he is clearly lying that he wants to see crypto succeed, and instead has a very biased agenda. He is not debating in good faith. If you check his profile, he had posted that BTC would be a failure even before the roll out. Literally, before the plan was implemented and went live, he claimed it would be a failure. Anyone really expect this guy to be unbaised at this point? \n\nComing to the protests, yes there are protests, but the protests are to do with politics rather than bitcoin. You will find one or two guys carrying an anti-bitcoin banner in the entire protest. Most of the protests are purely due to political reasons, that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. All those pictures he has posted as proof are all from protests shared on twitter, they have nothing to do with bitcoin except that fact that Bitcoin is implemented by the president, against whom all the protests are targeted. \n\nThat guy claims Bitcoin rollout is \"not going well\". \n\nStats from Google app store and IOS app store prove him wrong. \n\nThe Chivo wallet is still #2 on ios app store, ahead of most viral apps like FB/ Whatsapp/Twitter/TikTok etc\n\nhttps://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/apple/store-rank/sv/all/\n\n\nAnd on Android play store, the wallet is the #1 app too..\n\nhttps://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/store-rank/sv/all\n\nThe Chivo app is pretty much TOP on both app stores. Quite some failure huh! Definitely not doing well...\n\nJust because there have been some issues during rollout doesnt mean its a failure or its not going well. Many mass implementation programs have problems initially, infact even the US covid stimmy checks took a while to arrive and there was implementation delays. Later, [WaPo reported that over 1 M checks went out to dead people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/06/25/irs-stimulus-checks-dead-people-gao/). Was that a failure too? \n\nNow lets look at some real stories that are success:\n\nOver 3 million  users have downloaded the wallet. \n\n[More users in El Salvador are now using Chivo / have a bitcoin wallet than they have traditional bank accounts.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2021/10/07/in-el-salvador-more-people-have-bitcoin-wallets-than-traditional-bank-accounts/?sh=7ac1bb5020b5) - This alone is a massive win, in a country where huge amounts of people are unbanked, they have now instantly been given access to the world's most open and fair financial network. \n\n Already, Brazil is considering following El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as well.\n\n\nA country implementing BTC is not a race to the finish, it is a long term program. OP knows that too, but since he is a biased propagandist, he wants to put out hit pieces on a monthly basis \n\nThat guy is just grinding his grudge against the president who he clearly hates, and using this sub as an outlet to air his political hit posts.",

    "postText": "I started investing my dad\u2019s money while he knows nothing about crypto, here\u2019s a funny thing that happened. First of all, My dad asked me to invest some of his money into crypto, as I know a bit about it and I\u2019m doing relatively well. He knows nothing about crypto, but trusts me and acknowledges the volatility. I, in no way, persuaded him to invest in crypto.\nHaving said that, here\u2019s what happened;\n\nI downloaded a portfolio app on his phone so that he can track the crypto I bought and also so he keeps up with what I\u2019m doing with his money. Naturally, I keep plenty of funds in a stablecoin (in this case usdt) so that I can buy potential dips.\nOne afternoon I kept getting calls from him on my workphone (he never calls me on my workphone). Flustered, I picked up the phone during an important meeting, fearing something bad had happened. When I picked up he said the most boomer thing I ever heard him say \u2018Hey, I have been tracking this coin usdt you bought, and it is not doing much, it\u2019s not fluctuating at all, but I\u2019m really, really expecting a rise soon, what do you think?!\u2019\n\nI found it absolutely adorable and dumb at the same time. I explained everything to him and we had a good laugh about it. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this giggle I had. Hope it also brings you some joy in these trying times.\n\nEDIT: Wow, this post really exploded. Thanks for all the awards and love kind strangers. I see there is some controversy about the whole 'Tether' thing. I appreciate you guys looking out for me and my father. I truly do. Having said that, I don't feel the need to fuel this discussion. I think everyone is entitled to his own crypto choices and my dad trusts me enough to make those choices for him. It was not the intention of this post to start a tether-riot. It was simply meant to share a funny crypto-related story. Oh, and for the people saying this is a repost. I did try to post this about a month ago I think, but it got instantly deleted by the mods because I didn't have the required Comment Karma to post on this subreddit. I just thought I'd try to share my story again now having the required Karma. Anyway, I hope all of you have a wonderful crypto-journey. I'm still reading all the comments. It truly makes my day!

    "postText": "Crypto.com introduces Worldwide Account Protection Programme, protects victims of unauthorised transactions of up to USD$250,000 Just read the security report from Crypto.com in an official press release issued barely 3 days after the recent hacking.\n\nI think this is impressive not just for CDC but for the crypto market in general, in building confidence in cryptocurrency. This is so vital considering how crypto is still held in suspicion by many.\n\nTo quote them:\n\n>Crypto.com is introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP). WAPP offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com App and the Crypto.com Exchange.  \n>  \n>WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user\u2019s permission. WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms & conditions apply.\n\nSome noteworthy things you must do to qualify for the WAPP:\n\n* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available,\u00a0\n* Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,\n* Not be using jailbroken devices,\u00a0\n* File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and\u00a0\n* Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.\n\nThe WAPP will begin rolling out in select markets starting 1 February 2022.\u00a0\n\nCDC has also :\n\n1. migrated to a new 2FA infrastructure, with a longer term plan to migrate  to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n2. Introduced an additional layer of security on 18 Jan to add a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new whitelisted withdrawal address, and first withdrawal.\n3. Full audit of the entire infrastructure\n4. Engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checks + threat intelligence\n5. And of course, all affected customers have been fully reimbursed.\n\n[Here's the link to the report.](https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps)\n\nEDIT: Sincere thanks for the awards!  \nEDIT2: I really didn't expect this to blow up. Thank you all for the awards! I just want to add that, yes I am a CDC customer, but I also hold many other tokens and coins, and I'm well aware of the amount of suspicion and misunderstanding many people have regarding crypto. It's really important that, as time passes, the crypto world shows that it cares, it is relatable and it adds value. That's why I decided to share about this. I am also learning that other exchanges offer similar - but maybe it's not marketed as well. Marketing is awareness. And it's true that the way a service provider reacts to a crisis is key to its public perception. thanks for reading!",

    "postTitle": "I spent 5 hours researching what a DAO is so you didn\u2019t have to.",
    "postText": "I spent 5 hours researching what a DAO is so you didn\u2019t have to. **What is a DAO?**  Standing for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a DAO is an internet-native blockchain-derived investor-directed venture capital fund organization managed by all members. At its core they have an objective to provide a decentralized business model for all future enterprises. Mark Cuban called them \u201cthe ultimate combination of capitalism and progressivism.\u201d\n\nOne important aspect is that all code is open-source. This is done with the aim to eliminate human error, manipulation, and third parties, by having an automated crowdsourced process of decision-making. Unlike a company, DAOs have democratized organizations allowing all members to vote for any implemented change. The DA organization is represented by transparent computational rules, secured on the digital ledger across the internet, hardened against forgery by timestamping, and disseminated as a distributed database. The DAO is controlled by the members; no managers or basses are needed.\n\n>Bitcoin in essence is the first fully functional DAO with programmed rules and functional autonomy through consensual protocol; the miners and nodes signal voting through support.\n\n**DAOs need four things really;**\n\n* A set of rules,\n* A funding token,\n* Voting right provisions,\n* A clear structure & roadmap\n\n|**DAOs**|**A traditional corporation**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Flat hierarchy.|Hierarchical.|\n|Voting required for any changes.|Changes demanded from sole party, voting   may be offered.|\n|Voting outcome implemented automatically.|Tallied internally and outcome handled   manually.|\n|Services handled automatically in a decentralized manner.|Human handling, centrally controlled automation, prone to error and manipulation.|\n|All activity transparent and public.|Activity private.|\n\n**Creation of a DAO:**\n\n* Step one; create a smart contract that once launched the rules can only be changed by coded governance system.\n* Step two; sources of funding must be determined and governance must be engaged, typically funded via token sale that come with voting rights.\n* Step three; deploy smart contract on the blockchain from which point onward stallholders will decide future organization. The dev(s) have no more influence than any other stakeholder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How can I join a DAO?:**  Just invest in their token, and boom, you\u2019ve joined. The smart contract token you just bought establishes the DAO\u2019s rules, most likely you have to stake the token or another in the DAO to get voting rights and influence operations. This is typically done by deciding on and creating governance proposals. The fact that you need to stake to create proposals is to prevent spam proposals, and only (typically) proposals will pass if a majority of stakeholders approve (different percentage majority per DAO; specified in the smart contract).\n\n**What\u2019s the point? Where is the need?**  Are we all not internet native, or soon will be? DAOs are internet-native organizations with technological advantages compared to traditional companies. They have and establish a higher level of trust then say, the classical corporate hierarchy. Only the open source code needs to be trusted which is transparent thus auditable and verifiable at any time. This solves the economic principle-agent-dilemma where there may be a conflict of priorities between a group and those making the decisions for the group. The answer is community governance where incentives are aligned. There are charity DAOs, ones for NFT investments, for funding projects by Black women and non-binary artists, for funding women and non-binary crypto founders, some are exclusive social clubs, and others are for-profit business applications. I\u2019ve even seen freelance DAO networks of contractor.\n\n>**Examples of DAOs:**  Aragon, MakerDAO (MKR), DAOstack, DASH, JennyDAO, Jelurida, SharkDAO, DAOhaus, RaidGuild, Proof Of Humanity, Opolis, BanklessDAO, MolochDAO,\n\n**Downsides of DAOs:** No organization is perfect, decentralized or autonomous or not. This is extremely new technology that continues to attract criticisms over legality, security, and structural issues. As a DAO can be distributed across multiple jurisdictions, there is no legal framework. One may have heard about \u2018The DAO\u2019 crashing, as back in 2016. \u2018The DAO\u2019 was launched on Ethereum and raised $150 million in ETH (largest crowdfunding effort at the time) but a few days later developers expressed concern about a bug that would allow malicious actors to drain funds, and while a proposal was set forth to fix it an attacker took $60 million worth of ETH. At the time, 14% of all circulating ETH was invested in \u2018The DAO\u2019. Chaos ensued and a hardfork was implemented on ETH. Those who disagreed moved to support an earlier version of the ETH network, which became known as Ethereum Classic, or ETC. Point being if any gaps in the contract framework aren\u2019t closed before launch, it can lead to potential theft and money loss. *There is no such thing as a fully D & A organization.*  Depending on governance, there are only various levels of decentralization. While the network may have independent but equal network actors, the smart contract rules themselves will always be a centralized loss of direct autonomy; architecturally and geographically decentralized yes but logically centralized on the protocol. Upgrading of code is often delegated to experts who understand techno-legal intricacies of code and are therefore a point of centralization.\n\n**Future of DAOs:**  Despite the potential for DAOs to revolutionize the industry, and be a disruptive force to corporate structuring as a whole, they face security and legality issues.  As we all know the SEC claims some blockchain based companies might have made illegal offers of unregistered securities. There is also a lack of understanding about cryptocurrencies from new investors, not to mention the technical competence one needs to understand the computational infrastructure and consensus mechanisms within the smart contract to feel good about investing in it. It\u2019s not all bad though, Wyoming just became the first state to recognize DAOs as legal entities. DeepDAO says there are about 181 DAOs, with an ecosystem\u2019s total assets under management (AUM) of $13.4 billion.\n\nSomewhere, in some business boardroom, people are trying to figure out how to integrate self-driving cars into DAOs of autonomous taxi drivers. You order an Uber and it comes, no company, just code.",

Each time people were saying the same things like \"Yes, now this is definitely the one that will replace Ethereum and I haven't missed the boat on it\" and guess what they never did. This is the boat I believe ADA is in. It isn't all just about the tech. Smart contracts are currently not as big in the world to the point where superior tech makes that big of a difference (hence why all the other \"Ethereum killers failed\" even with better tech). Ethereum has such a huge network effect as well as first-mover advantage where I can't see it getting flipped any time soon, especially with EIP 1559 coming out in July and ETH 2.0 being fully released (within a year?). At this point, most people/whales that are buying ETH are not in it for the tech but for what it is - the second most valued crypto (and generally more stable than the altcoins). Do I see ADA raising in value in the short-term or mid-term? Probably (assuming they deliver on what they say). Do I see it ever competing with ETH in the long term? Definitely not.

A lot of tiktokers were promoting it, it had a really well made website, all social media platform, telegram etc.. so it seemed promising to me. I decided to set an alarm for 9:00 AM which was the launch time. And I decided to invest a little over $3,000 into it. My hope was if I get in early I can possibly 5-10x my money and get out. Purchased the coin and watched the buy and sell orders fly in. Then, a massive amount of buys and ZERO sells. I didn\u2019t think much of it but I go and shower for work and I come out and it goes from .07 to .0001. They dumped everything, no one was able to sell. The developers cashed out and I lost everything. I honestly am at a point in my life where my job is making me so depressed so like a lot of people I\u2019m looking for a get rich quick method, and meme coins seem to be what the hype is all about now.

I know that\u2019s a stupid decision to make but it made sense to me and I\u2019m just doing my part and warning people to always do research and be cautious and never invest money you can\u2019t loose.

Well, PoolTogether isn't just any lottery. It's a DeFi protocol allowing for \"no loss lotteries.\" How? Users are able to deposit funds, & yield is given to a verifiably random address in the pool. Losers can then still withdraw their assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxdhkz5vn5v81.jpg?width=1017&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e5a9657ec4839cc0175e3987fb97957017656b2\n\n# Aave Flash loans\n\nIf I told you that you could get millions of dollars in assets in seconds, with no bank, with no collateral, and at no risk to the lender... I'd probably sound crazy, right? Well, flash loans on Aave are built to be repaid in the same tx, otherwise it'll revert and fail. You can do this to perform arbitrage trades and other cool things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvo2akyxn5v81.jpg?width=574&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef6e331a505d1c9a3b9814d5d979dfc51b699672\n\n# Gambling\n\nWant to place a bet? There are many options to choose from on Ethereum, the most popular being augur. This is a global, no-limit betting platform where you can bet on sports events, economics, world events, and a whole lot more on a decentralized marketplace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thvxkqtwn5v81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a96eec9d9b201dcf23373d075447582045a97ac\n\n# Yield farms\n\nNot interested? Do you prefer to just hodl your coins and not think about them? Why not earn some passive interest in the process! Head over to YFI & join the yield farms, with many different options to choose from. The YFI community works hard at developing strategies for their vaults, acting like a high interest savings account. Users can deposit & immediately start earning yield!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yc8bosuyn5v81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7b30cdb16cf1d4a1e5d0649251e81f802517eb3\n\n# DEX liquidity providing\n\nSpeaking of liquidity mining... Do you have assets that you\u2019re bullish on and that you want to put to work? Many DeFi protocols such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, & Curve are in need of liquidity. Deposit tokens of your choice to start earning yield in different tokens, & earn trade fees on swaps! Careful though as this exposes you to impermanent loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4oqabd0o5v81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12f2b0e93b1d6deadb1fab38d02e7ea97475ed0f\n\n# Lido (staked eth)\n\nDo you hate having to worry about opportunity cost of locking up your eth? Of course, that's not a problem for DeFi. Simply access liquid staking derivatives in order to unlock liquidity and put it to use. sETH represents staked ETH on Lido. After depositing, these sETH can be used in DeFi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zldclbe1o5v81.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cacfd74f24133883b14f06d63d0de6ced475fc0\n\n# Curve\n\nThis protocol is an absolute behemoth with about $20 billion in TVL making it the largest protocol by total value locked. Visit Curve to start earning complex, double digit yields on your holdings. Curve has incentivized stablecoin pools, which people use to trade high volumes with minimal slippage, and even conduct arbitrage for yield.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hk5c8ph2o5v81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e134b3eeed1b1ea55defa2a7c20cf0c9f3fb983\n\nYou can stake your CRV tokens on convex finance to earn yields from curve trading volume and bribes from protocols trying to incentivize liquidity. This is a whole rabbit hole that I will make another post about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Abracadabra\n\nHave some more appetite for risk? Go beyond just yield farming and take on leveraged yield farming! Some protocols allow users to deposit interest-bearing assets, and borrow stablecoins Tokens earning yield on CRV can be used as collateral for Abracadabra, for maximized composability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ksh04x3o5v81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f1578b6bb30ab67d755ee876b849dd58bf6e1b1\n\n# Balancer\n\nWant to balance pools?Balancer is a liquidity provision dapp allowing users trade on various tokens. Rather than swapping tokens in several pools, Balancer only ever transfers the net amount of tokens out of a single pool, resulting in significantly cheaper trades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iyin68z4o5v81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a72e544836c19642d7008975e1388eb78379e488\n\n# Synthetic stocks/forex\n\nWant to trade other real world assets on the blockchain? Synthetix offers a platform for users to swap various synthetic tokens like stocks, forex, or even precious metals! They use oracles which take data off-chain and bring them on-chain to offer tokens which are pegged to real life assets...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7j5swst5o5v81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8a64e4121f821e296e41e42116afe044be90b99\n\n# Defi pulse index\n\nDon\u2019t want to think about it all too much and just wanna passively invest in an index? Of course it's possible. There are a handful of DeFi native indexes that offer exposure to a basket of assets in a single, convenient token. This can be an index of the top tokens in DeFi, a basket of NFTs, or anything else you could imagine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qa7xiu47o5v81.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79a642ab587aaa9ca298005fb11e3788cec678fc\n\n# DYDX\n\nWant to trade with leverage?

    "postTitle": "50 crypto terms you should know",
    "postText": "50 crypto terms you should know If you're just getting started with crypto, or are struggling with all the terms that go around on this subreddit, this list is for you.\n\nBehold the top 50 crypto terms you should know!\n\n* **51% attack**\n\nA 51% attack represents the situation where more than half of the computing power within a given blockchain of one person or one concentrated group. This ensures that this group gains full control over this blockchain. For example, they can stop all mining, stop all transactions or spend every coin of this specific blockchain infinitely often.\n\n* **Address**\n\nA cryptocoin address is the location where you store your crypto coins and from where you send and receive your coins. You could compare it with your home address. This address usually consists of a whole row of numbers and digits, which looks something like this: 1KXghhUZRVFmfk9Jreo3vvuV3HDoCJyYJZ. This address is the public part of the two encrypted keys (see private and public key) that are required for the holder to verify a transaction.\n\n* **Airdrop**\n\nThis is a kind of giveaway for founders who determine a particular cryptocurrency, giving those coins or coins away. The promotion is for a short period. This is done to publicize the tokens and distribute the tokens.\n\n* **Altcoin**\n\nThis name is used for all crypto coins that are not Bitcoin (alternative coins).\n\n* **Altseason**\n\nThis is the term given when money flows to altcoins faster than Bitcoin. In other words, when investors buy more altcoins than Bitcoin.\n\n* **AMA**\n\nAsk me anything. A (mostly) new crypto project likes a session for users to ask them questions about the project. Reddit and Discord are often used for this.\n\n* **AMM**\n\nAutomated Market Maker. That is to say, it is a kind of decentralized exchange platform (DEX). A mathematical formula is used to price assets. In a traditional exchange, it works differently, and assets are priced according to a price algorithm.\n\n* **Arbitrage**\n\nBuying and selling the same asset on two exchanges to take advantage of small price differences.\n\n* **ASIC mining / miner**\n\nASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. This is, in fact, a chip that is specially designed to perform one specific task. For this reason, thanks to ASIC mining, you can mine coins a lot faster than a regular computer or laptop could. For example, for Bitcoin, there are special ASIC miners who are only concerned with solving the SHA-256 algorithm. There are also crypto coins that are impossible to mine with an ASIC.\n\n* **ATH**\n\nATH means All Time High. This is the highest price a cryptocurrency has ever achieved.\n\n* **Bag**\n\nA bag in the crypto world refers to the coins and tokens that you hold as part of your wallet. Typically, the term is used to describe a significant portion of a particular cryptocurrency. For example, a 'moon bag' is filled with the coins you currently own that you think will make you rich.\n\n* **Bear market**\n\nA bear knocks everything down with its claws. That is why a market where the trend is in a downward movement is called a bear market. Sentiment is then negative and prices predominantly fall.\n\n* **Blockchain**\n\nA blockchain is a kind of digital ledger of transactions that works from a decentralized network. Thanks to cryptography, a ledger can be kept by a large number of computers that together create the network. Every time a new transaction is made, it is added by the miners with date, size, etc. to the blockchain as a new block.\n\n* **Block**\n\nThe blocks are the \"pages\" in the digital ledger of the blockchain. These are files with immutable data that are permanently stored on the blockchain.\n\n* **Block reward**\n\nThe block reward is the reward that miners receive for finding a mathematical solution related to that block. With Bitcoin, this reward is 25 Bitcoins per mined block. This halves every 210,000 blocks.\n\n* **BTFD**\n\nBuy the f \\* cking dip! This term is used when the price of a cryptocurrency or the market is in a dip. People are inclined to leave because they are afraid of losing. But a dip offers opportunities to buy a coin or token cheaply before it starts to rise again.\n\n* **Buy the Dip**\n\nSame as BTFD only without the expletives.\n\n* **Bull market**\n\nA bull stabs its horns and throws you up. That is why a Bull Market is a market where the trend is in an upward movement. Prices are rising and sentiment is positive.\n\n* **Cold storage**\n\nCryptocurrency is stored \u201coffline\u201d. You do this if you want to safely store coins for a longer period of time. A hardware wallet is an example of cold storage.\n\n* **Cryptography**\n\nAlso called secret writing. This focuses on techniques for hiding or encrypting information to be sent so that it is impossible for anyone accessing the channel on which it is sent to find out what information was sent.\n\n* **Cryptocurrency**\n\nA kind of digital currency based on cryptography. This concerns both Bitcoin and other altcoins.\n\n* **DAO**\n\nA DAO is a \"decentralized autonomous organization\" and can be described as an open source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically perform certain actions without the intervention of intermediaries.\n\n* **dApps**\n\nThese are decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers rather than a single computer, and are beyond the reach and control of a single authority.\n\n* **DeFi - Decentralized Finance**\n\nDeFi, or decentralized financing, is a new way to conduct financial transactions through applications. It excludes traditional financial institutions and intermediaries and is run through the blockchain. Think of it as removing brokers, exchanges, banks and other middlemen from the equation.\n\n* **DEX**\n\nA DEX is a Decentralized Exchange or a decentralized exchange. Decentralized exchanges are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without an intermediary. No identification is required at these exchanges.\n\n* **Distributed & Central Ledger**\n\nA distributed ledger is an agreement of shareable, shared, and synchronized data, which in this case is spread across several networks. These networks are then distributed over many computers.\n\nWith a central ledger, the synchronized and shareable data is controlled by one network or individual.\n\n* **Double Spending**\n\nThis means that a particular cryptocoin can be spent more than once. This stops the blockchain from working.\n\n* **Dust Transaction**\n\nA transaction of extremely few coins that represents almost no value, but takes up space on the blockchain.\n\n* **ECDSA**\n\nElliptic Curve Digitial Signature Algorithm is a lightweight cryptographic algorithm used to sign transactions on the Bitcoin protocol.\n\n* **ERC20 token**\n\nAn ERC20 token is in some ways comparable to Bitcoin, Litecoin and any other cryptocurrency; these tokens are assets based on blockchain technology. They have value and you can send and receive them. ERC20 tokens are only issued on the Ethereum network.\n\n* **Escrow**\n\nA concept in which financial assets are held by a third party to protect them during an asynchronous transaction.\n\n* **Fiat money**\n\nCurrencies that were once backed by gold (golden standard). Currently it only has value because people value it.\n\n* **FOMO**\n\n\"Fear Of Missing Out\". This often occurs when a cryptocurrency increases in value so quickly that people are afraid that they will miss the boat to riches, causing the price per coin to be even higher.\n\n* **FUD**\n\n\"Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt\". This crypto term is often used to describe the volatility of the crypto market.\n\n* **Fork (branch / split)**\n\nA fork happens when an alternate operational version of the current blockchain separates permanently. This can be done in three different ways:\n\n* By a 51% attack\n* Because there is a bug in the program\n* Because new substantial changes have to be made to the current blockchain.\n* **Genesis block**\n\nThe block mined first in a blockchain\n\n* **Halving**\n\nThis means that the minable reward (see block reward) is halved. This happens every time with a certain amount of mined blocks. With Bitcoin, for example, this is for every 210,000 blocks.\n\n* **Hash**\n\nA mathematical process that takes a variable number of data as input and produces a shorter result of a fixed length.\n\n* **Hashrate**\n\nThis is the speed at which the math problems for certain blocks can be solved. In other words, the speed at which a new block can be discovered. ASIC mining, for example, causes the hash rate to go down.\n\n* **HODL**\n\nOriginally 'Hold' was meant, but in a tipsy mood a chat participant kept talking about how he was 'hodling' his coins. This quickly became a meme and now it has become established in the crypto world and means holding onto your crypto coins for the long term. Sometimes it also refers to 'Hold on for dear life'.\n\n* **ICO**\n\nStands for Initial Coin Offering. This is a form of crowdfunding, where the public can invest in a blockchain startup in advance. As a thank you for the financial support they are rewarded with a certain amount of coins.\n\n* **IEO**\n\nThis is an Initial exchange offer. It is a variant of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), managed directly by cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n* **KYC**\n\nThis stands for 'Know Your Customer'. It refers to the verification process that customers must go through to verify their identity and associate it with a cryptocurrency wallet. Crypto exchanges gain a better understanding of the potential client's activities and can determine whether or not they are legal in nature. A legal requirement for many central exchanges (CEX) to admit customers to their fair.\n\n* **Mining**\n\nMining is the crypto term used to search for new block rewards. For finding and solving blocks, a reward is given to the miner.\n\n* **Moon**\n\nWhen a cryptocurrency \"goes to the moon,\" it means people think its price will rise exponentially.\n\n* **Multisig (multiple signatures)**\n\nMultisignature is a form of technology that ensures that extra security is added to Bitcoin transactions. Multisiganature addresses require another user to sign the transaction before it can be added to the blockchain.\n\n* **NFT**\n\nAn NFT is a Non-fungible Token. They are unique and cannot be exchanged. They live on the blockchain.\n\n* **Node**\n\nA node is a computer connected to the crypto network that uses a client tasked with validating and tracing transactions. Each node receives a copy of the current blockchain, which is automatically downloaded when it joins the Bitcoin network.\n\n* **P2P**\n\nThis stands for peer-to-peer. A (crypto) term that refers to computers that directly build a network with each other without a central server in between.\n\n* **Privacy coin**\n\nThese are a class of cryptocurrencies that enable private and anonymous blockchain transactions by obscuring their origin and destination. Some of the techniques used include hiding a user's real wallet balance and address, and combining multiple transactions to circumvent chain analysis. Examples are Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).\n\n* **Private key**\n\nA string of letters and numbers that is kept secret by the user. It is specially designed to sign a digital transfer using a public key. In the case of Bitcoin, this is a private key that must work with a public key.\n\n* **Public key**\n\nA string of letters and numbers that is public and can be viewed by anyone. This can be used in combination with a private key to sign a digital transaction.\n\n* **Pump and Dump**\n\nThis is a crypto term used for the unethical process of pumping and dumping a relatively cheap coin. The coin is first obtained in a very cheap way by a certain group of persons who then \"pump\" the coin (make its value rise sharply) by advertising it a lot. When the coin has appreciated enough, they dump their coins with a lot of profit, leaving a large group at a loss.\n\n* **PoW**\n\nStands for Proof-of-Work. This is a system that links computing power with mining capacity. The more powerful your computer can mine, the more you will be rewarded for this.\n\n* **PoS**\n\nStands for Proof-of-Stake. This is a system that links the interest in a particular crypto coin to the mining capacity. This means that the more tokens you own of a particular crypto coin, the more you can mine this coin.\n\nThe PoW and the PoS are both consensus algorithms. With this mechanism you can organize as a user, but also machines, in a distributed environment. All agents, the nodes of a blockchain, must agree on a single source of truth. Even if some of the nodes fail. This means that the system must be fault tolerant.\n\n* **DPos**\n\nStands for Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This is a variant of Proof of Stake that uses supernodes or masternodes to approve transactions.\n\n* **Scam coin**\n\nA coin created for the sole purpose of making the creator of this coin rich (usually through pump and dump).\n\nOften this is accompanied by a Pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members through a promise of payments or services to enroll others in the scheme, rather than providing investment or selling products.\n\n* **SHA-256**\n\nThe cryptographic algorithm used for Bitcoin's PoW system.\n\n* **Signature**\n\nA signature is a mathematical process by which someone can prove that he / she is the owner of his / her wallet. For example, a \"private key\" is used.\n\n* **Smart Contract**\n\nA two-way smart contract is an immutable agreement that is recorded on the blockchain, containing specific logical actions that are comparable to a \"normal\" contract. Once this contract has been signed, it can never be changed again. A smart contract can be used to set certain benchmarks that must be met in exchange for money.\n\n* **Wallet**\n\nSee \"address\"\n\n* **Whale**\n\nA whale is someone or a company that owns a large percentage of a particular crypto coin. It is often the case that a whale can also manipulate the price of this crypto coin.\n\n* **Whitepaper**\n\nA document that describes in detail the protocol of the crypto currency.\n\n* **Yield Farming**\n\nYield farming, this is also known as liquidity mining. This allows you to generate a way for rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. In simple terms, this means locking cryptocurrencies and receiving rewards. This happens on DeFi projects.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/MosDefi](https://twitter.com/MosDefi)   \nOr follow me on Medium: [https://mosdefi.medium.com/](https://mosdefi.medium.com/)",

    "postText": "The trading algorithm I made can now detect a new coin within 0.3 seconds of it being listed on Binance It's been about two weeks now since I initially shared with you a tool that I had made in order to quickly buy into a new coin listing to take advantage of the initial surge in the price.\n\nI've spent the past two weeks, debugging, fixing and optimising this code to get it to a level where it actually works. It's been a challenge to test since I have to wait for a new coin order and then check if it broke or not, but I think I finally got there.\n\nBefore I go explaining how the tool works, let me explain why I think that this particular strategy has some potential:\n\nAs some of you may have noticed, many coins seem to go through to what I would like to call a \"lightning-pump\" during their first few seconds of being listed on an exchange.\n\nHave a look at ICP (you may put your pitchfork down, this chart is the perfect example):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[chart for ICP](https://preview.redd.it/renmiomwk3k71.png?width=2650&format=png&auto=webp&s=74818add410e844f684bb0b0f0c43475de26a2f1)\n\nIn under a minute, the price of ICP shot up over 10 times, before slowly dipping into the void. Manually trading this 10x would be impossible, due to the speed required to catch this pump.\n\nSo I started building a bot that would detect new coin listings in about 20 seconds of them being listed on Binance.\n\nIt soon became quite clear that 20 seconds is way too slow to take advantage of the pump so I had to make it quicker.\n\nThe second improvement enabled the trading algorithm to find a new coin and place a buy order in about 5 seconds. This was better but not great.\n\nFinally, I decided to remove all the breaks and just call the Binance API like crazy. Full steam ahead.\n\nThe bot is now able to detect a new coin listing in 0.3 seconds and place an order. There haven't been any new coins listed after I made this improvement so I will let it run and share my results once I have them.\n\nI've also fixed any bugs that were caught by some of you that decided to test this out so thanks for that!\n\nFor anyone interested in trying it out, I've included a test mode that will simulate placing orders so there's no risk involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's a step by step guide on how to build it as well as an in-depth anatomy of the code:**\n\n[https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/)\n\n**For the GitHub source code please go here:**\n\n[https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins)\n\nIf you have any ideas on how to improve the stability or the speed of the code, please feel free to submit a PR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:**\n\n**For those of you who asked for a YouTube video before - here you go!** [**https://youtu.be/mIa9eQDhubs**](https://youtu.be/mIa9eQDhubs)",

    "postText": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a coin and a token?\u201d - a quick primer for beginners! I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mmltsq/why_do_we_have_coins_and_tokens_a_quick_primer/) article yesterday, to explain how a coin comes into play on the blockchain. I later realized that a lot of people may not know the differences between a \u201ccoin\u201d and a \u201ctoken\u201d, so I\u2019m going to explain that here!\n\nLet\u2019s start off with what a blockchain even is! A blockchain is just software that is open source and distributed across many computers. These computers that run the blockchain software are considered \u201cnodes\u201d, and they keep track of the blockchain ledger, and any coins, tokens, and transactions associated with it.\n\nThe \u201ccoins\u201d on the blockchain are just data (ones and zeroes) that is already written into the software. Using Bitcoin as an example, all 21 million Bitcoins are already in the Bitcoin software, and ownership of these coins is designated through the use of public and private keys, which gives the owners access to their Bitcoin on the blockchain. Also, with each new transaction block that is mined, new Bitcoins are awarded to the miners that processed these blocks. I touched on this whole process in my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mmltsq/why_do_we_have_coins_and_tokens_a_quick_primer/) post.\n\nIn other words, \u201ccoins\u201d on a blockchain are just part of the software itself, and are there from it\u2019s inception.\n\nTokens work a bit differently, in that they\u2019re smart contracts that are deployed onto a blockchain, and are not innate to the blockchain software itself. Using Ethereum as an example, a token (such as an ERC-20 token), is something that a user creates, and deploys onto the blockchain software via smart contracts. When a token is added to the blockchain, the creator of the token is able to write the rules for how a token will work i.e. the max supply, tokenomics, burn rate, functions, etc. All of this is handled in the smart contract portion of it\u2019s creation. Tokens do not have their own blockchain, so they have to abide by the rules of the governing blockchain i.e. Ethereum.\n\nHopefully this helps to explain the differences between a \u201ccoin\u201d and a \u201ctoken\u201d!",

I spent the last two days trying different platforms and importing API\u2019s. Nothing seemed to work. \n\nThankfully, I keep records of everything and was able link everything up manually over about six hours. Needless to say, dont be me.

Moreover, as per the full laws, you cannot carry forward losses to another year as well. Now it seems even in the same year, you cannot adjust it with gains from another asset. \n\nThe government is on a path of de-facto killing crypto by over regulation.

    "postTitle": "DeFi explained: Smart contracts",
    "postText": "DeFi explained: Smart contracts What is a smart contract? How do smart contracts work? And what are they good for? I'll try to answer these questions in this post.\n\n## What are smart contracts?\n\nA smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties in the form of computer code. The contracts are stored on the blockchain and cannot be changed. Transactions that take place in a smart contract are processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without the intervention of a third party. When you enter into an agreement with a smart contract, no confidential advisor is required. The transactions only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.\n\n## What can smart contracts do?\n\nSmart contracts help you exchange money, stock or anything else of value in a transparent, trustless manner, all while avoiding the services of an intermediary and the possibility of conflict. Smart contracts provide you:\n\n* Autonomy - You are the one who makes the deal and you don't have to rely on an intermediary to confirm transactions. The execution is automatically managed by a decentralized network, which excludes manipulation of contracts.\n* Speed \u200b\u200b- Automated contracts can save you hours on manual paperwork.\n* Security - Smart contracts are secured with similar cryptography that encrypts websites. In short, it keeps your documents safe.\n* Savings - Because they disable the presence of an intermediary, smart contracts can save you a lot of money. Where, for example, you would normally have to pay a notary to witness your transaction, this is now regulated by the blockchain.\n* Backup - Unlike files on your computer, data on the blockchain is duplicated many times over. So you do not have to be afraid of losing something that is registered on the blockchain. Also, there is no way anyone can say they lost the contract or the dog ate it.\n\n## A smart contract in effect\n\nAs an example; If you were to register cinema tickets on the blockchain using a smart contract, then as a visitor you will receive the tickets in your personal wallet. You only have to show the address to which the tickets were sent upon entry and the cinema can immediately be sure that you do not have any fake tickets and that you have actually paid for your tickets. This gives a better customer experience and the cinema can save a lot of costs in this way because it no longer needs ticket processing services.\n\n## But why is this so safe?\n\nThanks to blockchain technology, we can decentralize smart contracts so that they are fair and trusted. Decentralization means that they are not controlled by one central party, such as a bank or the government.\n\nThe blockchain is a shared database managed by many different computers (nodes). As a result, not one person or company has control over it. It also means that it is almost impossible to hack it and therefore smart contracts can be executed securely and automatically without anyone being able to change them.\n\n## Best practices for smart contracts\n\nIn principle, smart contracts can be used for any type of transaction, it does not have to be financial. Here are some industries where smart contracts can be used conveniently.\n\n## Insurances\n\nThe insurance world could be shaken up considerably by blockchain technology. An example of a smart contract was a project run by a French insurance company called AXA. AXA offered flight insurance that were paid out if the policyholder's flight was delayed by more than two hours. AXA was running a pilot project that payed out insurance via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Unfortunately the project has been discontinued.\n\nThe smart contract worked with an \u201cif / then function\u201d: IF the flight was delayed by more than two hours, THEN the policyholder would be paid. Because the smart contract was connected to a database that keeps track of flight times, the function could be performed automatically and paid for via the Ethereum blockchain. This would have saved a lot of time for AXA, but also for the policyholder. This is just one example of the many options that smart contracts offer.\n\n## Healthcare\n\nWithin healthcare, smart contracts will be used to record and securely transfer data. We can already see examples of smart contracts used in the medical industry, such as the company Encrypgen, for example. This is an application that uses blockchain to transfer patient data in a secure manner, eliminating the need for third-party access. In this way, the patients are in control of their own data. If researchers want to use patient data, they have to pay for it. The patient also chooses whether the data may be sold or not.\n\n## Governments\n\nGovernments guarantee that it is extremely difficult to manipulate the voting system, but despite that, smart contracts could alleviate all concerns by providing an infinitely more secure system. Smart contracts could also prevent low voter turnout. Much of the small turnout is due to a clunky system consisting of lining up a queue, showing your identity, and filling out forms. With the use of smart contracts, anyone can transfer their votes securely online, which is expected to generate much more response.\n\n## Business management\n\nThere is still a lot of room for improvement within business management and smart contracts can help a lot. Why do administration when everything is registered on the blockchain anyway? Right, the blockchain is already doing the work for you. You also do not have to make a pay slip every month. The money automatically goes to your employees as soon as they have fulfilled the agreements. Companies can simply set up a smart contract that states: IF the date is 10/20/2020, THEN $2500 will be sent to employee A. This means that employees will always be paid on time and that they will never be underpaid. The advantage of the company is that it is all automated, saving them a lot of time and money!\n\n## Fundraising (ICOs)\n\nIn principle, anyone could create their own token and sell it to the general public in order to raise money for a project. In 2017 there was a real ICO craze, where some projects managed to raise tens of millions within hours. There was even an EOS ICO that lasted for a year and racked up more than $ 4 billion in total!\n\nIf you want to organize an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) you create a token and a contract to sell the token. The function of the smart contract in this case would be: if person A sends an X amount of ETH, person A gets an X amount of tokens.\n\n## Smart contracts in a nutshell\n\nThe most important features of a smart contract are:\n\n* Digital Agreement - A smart contract is an agreement in the form of computer code.\n* Blockchain - Transactions are processed by a public database, based on blockchain technology.\n* Confidentiality - A transaction can only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt will be a while before smart contracts are everywhere in everyday life, but we can say with some certainty that the technology has a lot to offer.\n\nI hope this post helped you with:\n\n* Getting a better understanding of smart contracts\n* Understanding the significance of smart contracts within the crypto space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Next post: [NFTs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mexb51/defi_explained_nfts/)\n* Wondering which crypto wallet you need?

Credit: [https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1535623662153437185](https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1535623662153437185)\n\nDo kwon was a paper billionaire with no way to cash out without causing a depeg. Heres how he used degenbox to cash out into usdt/usdc\n\nLets start with what degenbox is: a borrowing protocol where people can loop stablecoin buys. You can stake collateral to buy UST, put it into Anchor, then use your aUST to borrow more UST, put it into Anchor again... You get the drill. It's Anchor on steroids. \n\n Terra influencers shilled this strategy en masse, and thousands of retail users began flooding into Degenbox to access the high yields.  This created incredibly thick, near-immovable liquidity near the top of the peg zone (the $0.98 to $1.00 range). In a nutshell, it would allow for someone to cash out billions of UST for MIM at a 1:1 rate without disturbing the peg - all thanks to inorganic demand. \n\nHere's the total amount of MIM Do Kwon was able to cash out through the MIM/UST pool - without even moving the peg! $2,719,132,772.01, to do with what he pleases. No need to dump LUNA or sell UST on exchanges - he drummed up liquidity from all of you. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/17acssrn40591.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=79356b83aef142fd546bcf33972658175e3050f1\n\nUST is the future, he said. Decentralized money is sound money, he said. UST won't depeg, he told you. 'Centralized stablecoins will rug you eventually.' So why did he cash out $2.7b from UST into USDT and USDC? Were all those words just lies? (Spoiler: yes.) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnqogfqt40591.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=e93885ed51bdb66e654f912358d6ff5b98688263\n\nHere are TFL's outflows. $558m to KuCoin, $1.08b to Binance, $545m to Huobi - you get the gist. Ultimately, all of this money is liquidity being removed from the Terra ecosystem, exacerbating the collapse, bolstering TFL coffers - all while they lied to your face.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zov83ccz40591.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e48c26e57df86fd7db10c3277c6b6208309b0c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/noikmgs050591.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=054257b4ccda21e26fa9bb70bdcf39662e6a951d\n\nAgain credit to [https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1535623662153437185](https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1535623662153437185) and also [https://twitter.com/fozzydiablo/status/1487191909948960776](https://twitter.com/fozzydiablo/status/1487191909948960776)",

Hundreds of Sol shills are trying to pretend the network wasnt down. Ironically, on Sol sub itself, someone agrees that not only did the network go down, but had to be rebooted too. This is hilarious lol, the network was rebooted but status dot solana shows 100% uptime. Well played, centralised tricksters.\n\n[From Solana's own sub - user there agrees the network went down and had to be rebooted. ](https://preview.redd.it/8437dvtr2o981.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd2e5e78b307be3a9bf41726d267d1be349c3d54)\n\nMany more LOLs if you go tough the Solana forums especially the validators groups\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"the network IS indeed fooked\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/4h45qqhb6o981.jpg?width=1312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90243e1a55f05986e3a05242f914db6e8e7616d0)\n\n[Absolute LOLs.

Not only did the network go down, as shown by Coinbase status and many complaints on Solana groups, the Solana devs and community managers also tried to suppress whats going on and the Solana status page flat out lies to users.\n\nI would honestly have not bothered going deep into Solana territory, but thanks to the 100 shills who attacked this post, we have all the juicy skeletons coming out of a SOL closet.. what a joke of a database.

    "postText": "Brace yourselves: In the coming weeks, crypto markets will explode like you\u2019ve never seen. Here are some essential tips to survive the madness. \n\t1. \u201cHodl\u201d is a meme for suckers.\n\nAs prices climb you\u2018ll start to hear a lot about hodling. [insert 300 and Braveheart meme here]. Just FYI: \u201cHodl\u201d comes from the early days when folks completely forgot about their Bitcoins until one day they heard on the news that this nerd money passed $1k/coin. They dug out their old wallet (if they were lucky enough to still have access) and thus woke up millionaires.  In short: their inadvertent holding made them exceedingly wealthy. \n\nThe fact is that \u201chodl\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cnever sell\u201d it just means \u201ctry not to sell before you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d There\u2019s nothing noble about \u201cnever selling\u201d your coins\u2014you tell yourself you\u2019ll hodl through thick and thin\u2014watch the comments like \u201cI\u2019m in cold storage and just grabbing the popcorn\u201d while the market is in free fall.\u2014but that means you have no idea just how cold crypto winter can get.\n\nYour \u201cloyalty\u201d will mean jack-all when your portfolio has gone from $300k to $3k. \n\n\t2. Take the Money and Run:\n\nSet a goal and STICK TO IT. If you\u2019ve made life changing money, or just enough for that goal: a new car, a new computer, college loans, etc.\u2014don\u2019t roll the profits over into the next coin poised to explode \u2014  just take the money and run. Do what you planned to with it, celebrate, and enjoy your success (no matter what that success looks like). The bear will come and you can buy back in.\n\nGreed is a bottomless pit and always chasing \u201ca little bit more\u201d will never make you happy. Remember that meme of the dude at the party standing in the corner while everyone else is having fun: \u201cThey dont know i have ETH.\u201d \n\nNews flash: yes they do. But even so, living is way more important than hodling\u2014and the people dancing, having a genuinely good time living life, are in a way better position than the guy in the corner with his ETH.\n\n\t3. You don\u2019t start spending the money until you\u2019ve lost the money.\n\nI remember the first time I experienced my portfolio climbing $5k/$10k per day. It was insanity. All of a sudden money became cheap. Easy to throw away, easy to take for granted. Amounts of money that I had never dreamed could have become accessible to me had suddenly become nothing more than crumbs. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the proceeding bear market\u2014when it had \u2018dip\u2019-by-\u2018dip\u2019 fizzled to almost nothing did I start to think about what I could have spent all that cash on. I had tried so hard to maximize my gains that I was afraid to sell anything\u2014lest my portfolio grow less exponentially than it otherwise would have. \n\nSo many moments in the proceeding bear market where I tormented myself with questions: \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I at least buy a nice car?\u201d Or \u201cI could have sold enough for a house and still have more in my portfolio than I currently have\u201d, or \u201cMan I could have bought so much ETH now if I had sold back then.\u201d \n\nA lot of regret made me fall out of love with \u201chodl\u201d.\n\n    4.  The bull market does come to an end.\n\nYes yes\u2014institutions, mainstream, celebrities, El Salvador, PayPal, etc. Blah blah blah.\n\nRemember: the \u201cinstitutions\u201d make money when the market goes up and they make more money when the market goes down. Governments are corrupt and will pass and nullify laws for their benefit. \n\nThe bull run will absolutely come to an an end\u2014and while no one knows when \u201cTHE\u201d bull ends, you can very much know when YOUR bull ends: when you\u2019ve hit your goal.\n\nBrace yourselves, and God Speed.",

From what I see this is happening now : \n\n1. CMC removed Korean exchanges\n2. Prices/graphs instantly tanked (but in practice not relevant to people outside Korea who dont trade there anyhow)\n3. Large number of people did not recognize what actually happened and that there were not moves/selling on their western exchanges\n4. Those same people are now dumping large amount of coins trying to \"cut loses\" because of the false impression that coin is crashing.\n5. Random stuff happening\n\nMy opinion is that this should have been handled much better by CMC. At least put a banner saying \"WE HAVE EXCLUDED KOREAN EXCHANGES BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT AND IT WILL HAVE SUCH INFLUENCE ON CALCULATIONS\". I just hope they do not put back and remove those exchanges at random point in time. Any thoughts?",

Probably gonna get downvoted to oblivion, so you could consider this reverse moon farming. Anyways, before anybody discredits me, I am studying Computer Science and have been able to land some nice internships, so yes, I admit that I'm not an expert and there are many things I don't know, however I would consider myself someone that has been exposed to basic Computer Science concepts, and more advanced ones in Algorithms, Data Structures and Cryptography.\n\nWith that out of the way, I just wanted to say that there are a lot of people here giving recommendations to new people (which is great) and there is this specific one that really irks me, \"Read the whitepaper\". Why does it annoy me so much?\n\n* Well, for starters I highly doubt that people giving these recommendations even read the whitepapers themselves, I honestly believe that they say this in order to look like \"responsible investors\" or \"being in it for the tech\", whatever their motives are, I believe that 99% are lying.\n* For the tiny minority that actually reads the whitepapers, I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but I highly doubt you understand the important technical part of the whitepapers completely. I say this because I've taken several high level CS courses in college and I struggle every time to grasp some concepts that describe how a certain project works and what makes it significant. I am certainly no guru, but I believe that I know more CS than the vast majority of people who are trying to get into crypto, and if someone like me can't understand what these whitepapers say, how exactly will a newcomer get any benefit from trying to read these documents?\n\nYou know, I remember I got into crypto right when I started college, and even now 3 years later, I prefer just watching a simplified video about a project than trying to read the whitepaper, which I know will be a waste of time. There is a reason why most projects upload a simplified version that explains how the project works, and that's so that newcomers can get an idea of what the project is. Odds are that the vast majority of people trying to buy a certain cryptocurrency will be people that just don't have the background required to understand whitepapers, so let's stop recommending them to read whitepapers and instead recommend them something different, like watching videos or reading simplified articles that explain what the cryptocurrency that they want to buy is.",

    "postText": "With a little spare time, you and a friend can end up owing the Federal Government $373 trillion dollars *today*, and we can completely wipe out the national debt. Imagine the following scenario:  \n  \n1.\tYou create a new nft out of thin air, named \u201cFucking\u201d. It is a single nft.  You own that nft.\n\n2.\t\u201cFucking\u201d has no value.  It was just created.\n\n3.\tYour friend creates a new cryptocurrency named \u201cStupid\u201d and issues 10 quadrillion coins (ten thousand trillions).  They have no value, they were just created out of thin air.\n\n4.\tHe then sells a single \u201cStupid\u201d coin to a third person for $1.  That third friend then also puts out a standing offer that he\u2019ll buy another \u201cStupid\u201d coin for another dollar, if your friend is willing.\n\n5.\tStupid now has a marketcap of $10 quadrillion dollars.  Remember that marketcap is a function of total number of coins x the current going price. That\u2019s it.\n\n6.\t\u201cStupid\u201d only has liquidity of a single dollar - that person that offered to buy another one for another dollar.  But that doesn\u2019t change the raw price nor marketcap.  \n  \n7.\tRemember your NFT, \u201cFucking\u201d?  Your friend agrees to buy your NFT for 1 quadrillion Stupid.  You sell it to him. \n  \n8.\tYou now own 1 quadrillion Stupid valued at $1 quadrillion dollars.  And good job, you just created a taxable event.  \n\n9.\tIt doesn\u2019t matter that you didn\u2019t convert to dollars; by the current law, crypto to crypto trade is considered a capital gain,  and you must pay taxes on the value of it.  Since your income this year is now $1 quadrillion dollars (from the sale of the NFT), you are getting hit with the maximum capital gains tax of 37% of that sale.  \n\n10. You owe the Federal Government $370,000,000,000,000.  It doesn\u2019t matter that your Stupid is actually worthless.  It doesn\u2019t matter that the liquidity is one dollar deep and you could never actually even sell enough to obtain enough money to pay even a fraction of a sliver of that tax.  All that matters is by exchanging one made up thing for another, the Federal Government suddenly has decided that you owe them a titanic sum of money you never had in the first place.\n\nWelcome to current US tax laws.  The best part is, since you would never be able to pay your 370 trillion dollar tax bill, the IRS would seize everything you owned that they could.  That includes your 1 Quadrillion Stupid.  But there\u2019s good news!  Since your 1 Quadrillion Stupid is valued at 1 Quadrillion Dollars you just single-handedly wiped out the national debt and brought America into a new age of prosperity.

    "postText": "Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency was invented in the first place.  \n\n* People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.\n* Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.\n* Banks  gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran  \u201cfractional reserves\u201d. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks  collapsed because of runs on the bank.\n* Central  banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort.  Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other\u2019s  deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered.  Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all,  banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.\n* Banks  would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient  trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments  would have to step in to save them.\n* All  ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when  Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed  amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now  effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks  could create.\n* From  this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be  supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and  lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to  them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But  these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And  reserves are much lower than the loans they make.\n* This  led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped  reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in  the supply of the euro of about 5%.\n* This  leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat  lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of  increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper  all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices  to drop every year. That they don\u2019t is the effect of money creation.\n* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.\n* Banks  have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase +  2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish  this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting  this money returned to them at an interest.\n* Apart  from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every  couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or  the system will collapse.\n* Apart  from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away  with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to  exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to  transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.\n* The  absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were  force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and  silver remain difficult to use.\n* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals  (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined  the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only  thrive if \u201cnobody\u201d launched it and if they was no central point of  failure.\n* What  was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what  Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the  problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with  the text: \u201c03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for  banks.\u201d. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial  system.\n\nSo, if you find  yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency\u2019s price, or bogged  down in discussions about the \u201cone true bitcoin\u201d, or constantly asking  what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.\n\nWe are here to fix the financial system.",

First up, Robinhood is a regulated trading platform that also includes crypto, it is fully regulated under US laws by the SEC. Yes, that SEC. During the bullrun of 2021 when prices were starting to spike, they disabled people from being able to buy crypto or load money onto your account. The reason they gave was ' extraordinary market conditions. ' In reality the bullmarket wasn't at its peak yet which would only occur November of 2021. It was starting to heat up and naturally people wanted to get in a bit earlier so they can make a profit.\n\nPeople were so angry that they left 100K+ negative reviews for Robinhood which Google went and removed for them. See what happens when a crypto service is under government control. They literally cheated retailers out of potential profits and are still operating today and many people still use them!\n\nThis is a warning, they also did it with GME which was a different stock, but we won't get off topic, you can google that if you want to know more. Just a heads up because the Btc halving is less than a year away, stay away from Robinhood. With them it's not a matter of if, but when. They will cheat you or potentially even steal from you, so why take the risk? Steer clear and buy and trade your crypto through other means, of course do your due diligence but whatever you do, don't do Robinhood.",

Crypto scams may be a problem but they love to ignore banks scams,the SEC is hot attacking crypto but silent on banks In another huge L for banks and mainstream media, Wells Fargo is fined another $1 Billion. They were also fined another 3.7 Billion back in December 2022. Of course, we heard very little to nothing of this from the media, as FTX were their three favourite letters. This is besides the fact tat the scamming went all the way back to 2016, scamming customers for near a decade. Given how these firms are constantly given slaps on the wrist, the $4.7 Billion probably doesn't even compare to the profits they made from said scamming. This likely means that the $10 Billion or so of customer funds that FTX lost is absolutely dwarfed by Wells Fargo in this scheme. Not just Wells Fargo, but virtually every major bank is caught in 3 - 7 violations every single year.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s misdeeds included wrongfully repossessing customer vehicles, improperly rejecting thousands of customer applications to modify their mortgages which lead to many losing their homes to foreclosure, charging illegal \u201csurprise overdraft fees\u201d on customers\u2019 debit card  transactions and wrongfully freezing more than 1 million consumer banking accounts.\n\nSo people lost, cards, homes, and funds to them. It is kind of ironic that so much is made of crypto scams. Sure, they are bad but at least we all admit it and don't delude ourselves. But people put their hard-earned money in a bank thinking it is 100% safe, take loans for house and cars only to be scammed out of it. I guess at least with shitcoins and exchanges, small ones especially, we know it's a gamble.\n\nAnd yet all we hear from the SEC is **crypto firms not \"coming under regulations\".** We know how scant and undefined those very regulations are. Even Biden made statements about the rich using crypto to evade taxes,while we all know tax evasion in traditional finance absolutely dwarfs crypto. Yet on matters of these **banks violating regulations multiple times very single year and making billions,** the SEC has stayed rather quiet.\n\nThis brings us all back to a central tenant in crypto of decentralisation. The idea is that it doesn't matter if the entity is in crypto, a bank or a traditional finance firm, centralization is not good. Any centralized entity is a centralization of power and power corrupts. Don't mistake the post for a endorsement of Cefi, just because it is crypto.

    "postText": "Brace yourselves. People who think they can become millionaires with 1k investment are coming. You feel it in the air. As soon as bitcoin reaches mainstream news due to high price, they are coming here. Newcomers, who have their first surplus after all the bills are paid and now think that crypto will go up 15% a week for another year or so.\n\n\"The math is easy! 15% a week for 52 weeks and my 1000 bucks will become almost 1,5 million!\" A flawless conclusion after extrapolating the (very recent) data.\n\nBut this is only the fist stage! The second stage:\n\n\"I invested after bitcoin shoot up 15% and now I am down 10%! How could that be? It is over and I need to sell!\" A sensible reaction after buying a volatile asset that was very overbought. But don't worry, they will be back next day after buying in again and losing a part of the initial investment for no reason.\n\nNow comes the third stage:\n\n\"I did the math again and realized that I will become a millionaire much quicker if a invest in this new CumElonDoge coin that I see everywhere. It quadrupled in a day so I will buy today and will be a carefree person in less than a week!\" A logical conclusion. Nothing with \"Elon\" in its name can go wrong! If you think otherwise, go fuck yourself!\n\nIf we are lucky, we could stop some of those people, but on the other hand... It is kinda fun seeing this level of idiocy but not being the idiot anymore. So maybe, sometimes, you could just say \"you go man! chase your dreams!\" and see what happens.",

    "postText": "The real use case for crypto is the most obvious. I was just quizzed by my bank of 20 years about what I wanted to withdraw cash for, then they REFUSED my withdrawal instead only giving me half I'm in Australia where the government recently passed a law to limit cash payments to $10,000. The law specifically wasn't supposed to apply to your own bank account. \n\nI just tried to withdraw $10,000 from Commonwealth Bank, where I have held an account for more than twenty years. \n\nI told them how much I wanted and said I preferably want it all in $50 notes, but if need be could have some in hundreds. That seemed ok, but then they asked my what I wanted it for. I told them that I wanted it because it was my money. They said I had to tell them because it might be for a scam. I said it wasn't a scam and I wanted my money. \n\nThe teller called the manager and told her that I wanted to withdraw $10,000. The manager asked me why and told me that I have to answer. I told them I wanted it because I was making a tik-tok video of how much cash I could feed a bear.  Obviously that was a mistake, because she responded \"That's a new one\" and then said she could only give me $5,000 and would that be okay? (For the record, I don't use tik-tok so this isn't the real reason, but I shouldn't have to justify to anyone why I want to keep my money as cash). \n\nLet's be clear -  they knew how much I wanted right up front. If it was an issue that they didn't have enough cash they should have said so straight off.  Deciding to only give me half of my money after hearing what I planned to do with it is absolute garbage. \n\nIt's my money not theirs.  But banks always seem to be forgetting this.",

    "postText": "A set of Jupyter Notebooks to help you understand ML algorithms of regression, dimensionality reduction, unsupervised clustering, KNN, neural networks, etc. Hey r/learnmachinelearning! I hope you all are all doing well. \n\nRecently I created SeaLion, a machine learning library designed to help newcomers learn ml in a way that's more about understanding the algorithm than its class functions. The librarie is well-tested and has 70+ stars on GitHub. \n\nIn order to supplement the library I wanted to write some examples of what these algorithms could be used for. I did this in a series of 12 jupyter notebooks. I think that they are incredibly helpful as they apply ml algorithms to real world datasets like breast cancer, iris, titanic, spam classification, moons  MNIST, etc. They also compare and contrast a lot of the algorithms so you can see first hand which is best to use. \n\nYou can find them over here : [GitHub Examples](https://github.com/anish-lakkapragada/SeaLion/tree/main/examples)\n\nA list of all of what the notebooks are on can be found in the screenshot below : \n\n[Code examples of SeaLion to explain ML algorithms](https://preview.redd.it/te7s16llvdg61.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f03d8f4c01c11708e2fdae2f265c3fad911e3f0)\n\nPlease feel free to use them. \n\nAlso if you want to learn more about sealion here are some links : \n\n[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/lf59bw/machine_learning_library_by_14year_old_sealion/)\n\n[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/anish-lakkapragada/SeaLion)\n\n[PyPI webpage](https://pypi.org/project/sealion/)\n\nGive it a star if you can; that always helps. \n\nI hope you enjoy the notebooks.

    "postText": "\"I forced a bot to watch over 1,000 hours of SpongeBob SquarePants and then asked it to write a SpongeBob SquarePants episode of its own.\" I saw this [tweet](https://twitter.com/KeatonPatti/status/1108739921932619777) and found out that he\u2019s actually a comedian who didn\u2019t really train a bot. I couldn't find anyone who had tried so I did it myself. Turns out there's only around 100 hours of SpongeBob SquarePants though.\n\nI fine-tuned the 'small' `124M` GPT 2 model using `gpt-2-simple` on SpongeBob SquarePants episode transcripts that I scraped from the [Transcripts Wiki](https://transcripts.fandom.com/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#Episodes). The GitHub repo with the code I used to generate the results is [here](https://github.com/mikhailgaerlan/TV-Show-Script-Writer). I plan to do more TV shows myself, but I would love to see other people try this with their favorite TV shows.

I change the learning rate slightly and suddenly no learning takes place. I add a layer and now need to run the net through thousands more training iterations. Change weight initialization and training is faster but it\u2019s way over fit. If I change the activation function forget everything else. God forbid there\u2019s an actual bug in the code. Then there\u2019s analyzing if any of the above tiny deviations that led to wildly different outcomes is a bias issue, variance issue, or both. \n\nWhen I look up how to make sense of any of this all the literature is basically just a big fucking shrug. Even Andrew Ng\u2019s course specifically on this is just \u201chere\u2019s all the things you can change. Keep tweaking it and see what happens.\u201d \n\nIs this just something I need to get over / gain intuition for / help research wtf is going on?",

Covering everything in great detail requires more than ~400 pages, but overall this is the most detailed guide on the mathematics used in machine learning. \n\n2.\t http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf\n\thttp://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf\n  These concise guides belong to the famous CS229 course by Andrew Ng and are very helpful for refreshing one's knowledge of linear algebra and probability theory. Don't expect it to be comprehensive. Expectedly, the primary purpose of the notes is to serve as a brief refresher that you can use to find out which subjects you should revisit.  \n\n3. \thttps://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html\n\thttps://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html\nVery close in quality and coverage to the notes above. \nBy the way, both the notes from Stanford and DL Book also include additional notes on optimization, information theory, and some other subjects. Those, however, are decently covered in mml-book.\n\n4. \thttps://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf\nThese notes spend less time on each subject, which doesn't make them bad though. I would recommend using this guide as a checklist of math prerequisites. \n\n5. https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/marc/teaching/18-Maths/paper.pdf\nMath for intelligent systems. The preface promises that this course will recap the essentials of linear algebra, optimization, probabilities, and statistics, which definitely sounds ambitious. Unlike other resources from the list, I have only briefly skimmed through the notes. \n\n6. \thttps://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html\nMatrix calculus you might need for machine learning. \n\n7. https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf\nA collection of facts and properties related to matrices. \n\n8.\thttp://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf\nThis is a great book on applied linear algebra in the context of machine learning. Not much time is spent on theoretical aspects, which is probably good considering the applied orientation of the book. \n\n9. http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf\nLuckily free book on convex optimization.\n\n10.\thttps://seeing-theory.brown.edu/\nI wish I was taught statistics using an approach like this.\n\n11.   https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/linear-algebra\n       https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/calculus\nhttps://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/unconstrained-optimization\nA set of truly visual courses that help you not only understand the subject but also see what's going on under the mathematical hood. \n\n12.\thttps://probabilitycourse.com/\nA free and high-quality book to learn probability and statistics. I believe the author has reached some sort of balance between rigor and intuition. \n",

Recently I decided to start a blog named [Boring Data science](https://guillaumelegoy.github.io/) to talk about the boring stuff in data science: testing code or data, setting up repositories, software engineering good practices, etc. So far it's aimed mostly at beginners or data analysts/data scientists/ BI analysts who want to adopt software engineering as part of their workflow. I believe in the value of reproducible code, testing, and security (devops aspect) in machine learning projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason behind this project is that, in my humble opinion, there is a plethora of amazing machine learning/data science blogs and tutorials, but not enough focusing on the \"boring stuff\" I mention above. I am very grateful to have worked and to be still working with amazing DBAs and engineers who taught me a lot, so this is my turn to give back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis blog is mostly a learning experience for myself as well, as writing down concepts help me understand them better, and I don't claim to be an absolute expert, but I believe this can help others (I wish I knew this when I started!). Feedback or ideas for future posts are highly welcomed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy coding!",

    "postTitle": "The hitchhikers guide to computer vision",
    "postText": "The hitchhikers guide to computer vision Hey there,\n\nThis is my first blog post ever - it is a summary of all the good knowledge that I have in the computer vision area. It is not a tutorial or how-to-use-something post, but rather a set of links, tips, lifehacks. Covers data governance, mlops, tools, courses. I tried to make it practical and useful. Link to the origin: [The Hitchhiker's guide to computer vision](https://irregularadel.substack.com/p/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-computer-21-04-28?r=l7n3m&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy)\n\nSo, are you tired of this towardsdatascience/medium tutorials and posts about deep learning? Don\u2019t panic. \u00a9 Take another one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I was thinking to add some DL meme at the beginning and my friend come up with this. Adel is me, by the way \\( \u0361\u275b \u1d25 \u0361\u275b\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/jmhcpovghyv61.jpg?width=1076&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eedf09c31fc497682b4dffed470f60efbb4a1617)\n\nSo, as I said, there are so many educational resources around the deep learning area that at some point I found myself lost in all that mess. There are tons of towardsdatascience/medium tutorials on how to use something, and most of them are on a beginner\u2019s level (although I enjoined some of the articles).\n\nI felt that there should be something higher than \u201cpiece of cake\u201d or \u201cbring it on\u201d levels. Like \u201chardcore\u201d or even \u201cnightmare\u201d. In the end, I want resources that will bring value, and not something I already know. I don\u2019t need detailed tutorials (well, usually), instead, I want to see directions. Some reference points from where I can start my own path. And it may be the case, that I can write such an article for others, who feel the same way.\n\nSo I came to the idea of a short \u201chow-to-and-how-not-to\u201d post on the computer vision area (mostly from DL perspective). Some links, tips, lifehacks. Hope it will create adding value for someone. And hope it won\u2019t be yet another boring tutorial.\n\nFinally, a small disclaimer: these are my personal beliefs and feelings, they are not necessarily true. Moreover, I feel that some of the points are not optimal solutions, and I would be happy if someone will propose a better option.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n## Now, let\u2019s start with the tools and infrastructure, for your CV research.\n\nIn general, several areas should be presented in your projects. There are a huge number of options in each area, and you can easily get lost. I believe that you should just choose one sample from each area and stick to it. These areas are:\n\n* Starting from simple. **Language** \u2014 without doubts, python. Others are way below. (Sorry R and [Matlab ](https://pics.me.me/pytorch-tensorflow-matlab-source-unknown-deep-learning-frameworks-war-52460350.png)users).\n* **IDE** \u2014 what IDE you will use? I personally use PyCharm, but know a lot of people who use VS Code. I know that there are Jupyter notebooks, google colabs. [Deepnote ](https://deepnote.com/)is quite a good tool as well. In fact, they all are nice, but not for proper R&D nowadays. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Jupyter notebook and use it a lot, but let\u2019s be honest, it is not IDE, but rather a research prototyping environment. A combination of jupyter notebooks and proper IDE will boost your projects a lot.\n* **Frameworks** \u2014 today there are only two main players in this area: Pytorch and Tensorflow. There are hundreds of comparison articles, and both frameworks are great (some [fresh discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k6n8m5/d_revisiting_the_tensorflow_vs_pytorch/) on Reddit). Again, just choose what you like the most and never regret it. My choice is Pytorch \u2014 like it as hell. There also wrappers of these frameworks, I use[ Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) \u2014 amazing stuff. There is a good [ecosystem around Pytroch](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) and sometimes I found something interesting and new there. Probably there is a similar thing for Tensorflow (sorry, too lazy to check)\n* **Data management** \u2014 very important and undeservedly ignored by the majority of people. There are amazing speeches of Andrej Karpathy about data importance, very inspiring \u2014 highly recommend ([this](https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8) \u2014 they are about a lot of things, tbh, but also about the importance of data). This is one of his slides that tells a lot. I use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for data version control \u2014 we also created a [data registry](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registries) in our team. We keep track of all the changes in original raw data there (adding new data, reannotations, changes). Enjoying it a lot. Nice developing is happening in Activeloop: [Hub](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub) is interesting solution and worth attention. Important thing: metadata is highly valuable as well. Never underestimate its importance. Data labeling could be a separate chapter, but I decided to put it here. Again, tons of image annotation tools on the market: choose the one that fits your need. We use [supervisely](https://supervise.ly/) at the moment, super convenient in distributed labeling. In general, be prepared to spend a lot of time on data: structuring, cleaning, labeling, visualizations, etc. \u2014 all that is, in my opinion, way more important than actual straight ML/DL stuff. This is just something you should deal with. So keep calm, and spent time on data. More about data management is [here](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/lecture-8/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ I a bit remade the image to make text more visible. ](https://preview.redd.it/byx7dmxjhyv61.png?width=1988&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d9391cd22b23f87d15dd5134d337dae1ce89557)\n\n* **MLOps** \u2014 something that everyone starts to talk about. To simplify: this is DevOps in the ML area. Probably, DVC can be related here as well. MLops is everything you will need to create a nice infrastructure for your ML projects. That includes experiments tracking, comparing, reproduction, models saving/tracking, CI/CD stuff that you can use. The market is full of free and paid packages. We use [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and like it a lot. We have an MLFlow server with a minio backend, we store all our team experiments there. At the same time, we have [a Model registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html), that helps a lot in production. It gives us version control over the models and an easy way to load them. MLflow is not the only solution, of course. Take a look at others: [W & B](https://wandb.ai/site), [comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/), [neptune](https://neptune.ai/). Also, nice free book: [Introducing MLOps](https://pages.dataiku.com/oreilly-introducing-mlops) from O\u2019Reilly & DataikuPlus some combination of this and previous bullet points: MLOps: From [Model-centric to Data-centric AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo) lecture from Andrew Ng.\n\n## Let\u2019s go to the methods and algorithms.\n\nCV is the most advanced field in DL (sorry NLP enthusiasts) and that causes the large variety of cool models/methods. On the other hand, each freaking day there is something new. Still, there are some classical constants that barely change. (in fact, if you are not into fundamental research, you can just choose some proven techniques and they will work. Well, most likely.)\n\n* There are always some SOTA back-bone architectures, and they are quite constant. Resnets are a good baseline, se\\_resnexts are usually way better. Efficient nets are also awesome. Unets are a solid choice for segmentation. FasterRCNN, yolos \u2014 for detection. MaskRCNN for instance segmentation (but usually you want a separate classification part).\n* A lot of nice Github repos on models mentioned above. Just google it, and find the one you like (or the one that fits in the current situation). For example, I enjoy this [pytorch segmentation repo](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch). Or this [efficient-net package](https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch).\n* Resources \u2014 first of all, [ml in reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/). All cool stuff ends up being posted there anyway, so this is a must-read resource. Then, Twitter (sorry). I am subscribed to guys like mentioned earlier Andrej Karpathy. Find the ones you respect and believe in and follow them. You can also subscribe to official Pytorch/Tensorflow/You-name-it accounts, they announce and retweet a lot of cool stuff as well. Best courses I\u2019ve seen: from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) (good DL for coders + SOTA algorithms discussed), [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/) \u2014 just the best practical course I\u2019ve seen. [Basics of conv nets](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from Stanford \u2014 classic. Kaggle is the perfect way to follow on development of the best tricks and techniques (crazy augmentations like mix up, cutmix, tricky loss functions, multi-head networks etc.). The creativeness of sportsmen (and people there are real sportsmen imho) never stops to surprise me. Plus there are usually winning solution blog post, so keep an eye on them\n\nSome words about GPUs\n\nMiners blow the market and GPUs costs like spaceship now. But anyway, there are different options you can use, either you buy your own GPUs or borrow them in the cloud. It is relatively easy to come up with some AWS or Google cloud solutions. Also, in my experience, for most of the tasks, a few 10\\*\\*/20\\*\\* are already a solid choice at the beginning. Of course, that depends on the task and data, but most likely you can survive with smaller scales for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ But, boi, how satisfactory is it to work with big GPUs. ](https://preview.redd.it/22x8zmplhyv61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b97920502a4f036490192e38e89d12c80d318b22)\n\nHope I didn\u2019t forget anything important!\n\nI wish that could help someone in this crazy world of computer vision.\n\nGood luck!",

No BS Hello everyone,\n\nI recently started a Youtube channel to discuss Machine Learning engineering topics where I share my screen,  implement things live and provide the code at the end.\n\nIn these videos, I'll show you how to build apps, scrape, train models, deploy them ... among other things.\n\nI guess it's more practical to see how things are done rather than you being told how to do them without proper guidance! Feel free to subscribe and follow  :-)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/AhmedBesbes/](https://www.youtube.com/c/AhmedBesbes/)",

    "postTitle": "Why You Don\u2019t Need to Learn Machine Learning",
    "postText": "Why You Don\u2019t Need to Learn Machine Learning I notice an increasing number of Twitter and LinkedIn influencers preaching why you should start learning Machine Learning and how easy it is once you get started.\n\nWhile it\u2019s always great to hear some encouraging words, I like to look at things from another perspective. I don\u2019t want to sound pessimistic and discourage no one, I\u2019m just trying to give an objective opinion.\n\nWhile looking at what these Machine Learning experts (or should I call them influencers?) post, I ask myself, why do some many people wish to learn Machine Learning in the first place?\n\nMaybe the main reason comes from not knowing what do Machine Learning engineers actually do. Most of us don\u2019t work on Artificial General Intelligence or Self-driving cars.\n\nIt certainly isn\u2019t easy to master Machine Learning as influencers preach. Being \u201cA Jack of all trades and master of none\u201d also doesn\u2019t help in this economy.\n\n# Easier to get a Machine Learning job\n\nOne thing is for sure and I learned it the hard way. It is harder to find a job as a Machine Learning Engineer than as a Frontend (Backend or Mobile) Engineer.\n\nSmaller startups usually don\u2019t have the resources to afford an ML Engineer. They also don\u2019t have the data yet, because they are just starting. Do you know what they need? Frontend, Backend and Mobile Engineers to get their business up and running.\n\nThen you are stuck with bigger corporate companies. Not that\u2019s something wrong with that, but in some countries, there aren\u2019t many big companies.\n\n# Higher wages\n\nSenior Machine Learning engineers don\u2019t earn more than other Senior engineers (at least not in Slovenia).\n\nThere are some Machine Learning superstars in the US, but they were in the right place at the right time \u2014 with their mindset. I\u2019m sure there are Software Engineers in the US who have even higher wages.\n\n# Machine Learning is future proof\n\nWhile Machine Learning is here to stay, I can say the same for frontend, backend and mobile development.\n\nIf you work as a frontend developer and you\u2019re satisfied with your work, just stick with it. If you need to make a website with a Machine Learning model, partner with someone that already has the knowledge.\n\n# Machine Learning is Fun\n\nWhile Machine Learning is fun. It\u2019s not always fun.\n\nMany think they\u2019ll be working on Artificial General Intelligence or Self-driving cars. But more likely they will be composing the training sets and working on infrastructure.\n\nMany think that they will play with fancy Deep Learning models, tune Neural Network architectures and hyperparameters. Don\u2019t get me wrong, some do, but not many.\n\nThe truth is that ML engineers spend most of the time working on \u201chow to properly extract the training set that will resemble real-world problem distribution\u201d. Once you have that, you can in most cases train a classical Machine Learning model and it will work well enough.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI know this is a controversial topic, but as I already stated at the beginning, I don\u2019t mean to discourage anyone.\n\nIf you feel Machine Learning is for you, just go for it. You have my full support. Let me know if you need some advice on where to get started.\n\nBut Machine Learning is not for everyone and everyone doesn\u2019t need to know it. If you are a successful Software Engineer and you\u2019re enjoying your work, just stick with it. Some basic Machine Learning tutorials won\u2019t help you progress in your career.\n\nIn case you're interested, I wrote an opinion article [5 Reasons You Don\u2019t Need to Learn Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-reasons-you-dont-need-to-learn-machine-learning-5f9b1ddf8eb5?sk=ff8c0476bd19f3ae32e71f6eefe703d4). \n\nThoughts?",

I hope this helps you if you are taking the specialization too or if you are just interested. I've tried to make them as informal and easy to understand yet correct as I could. The notes are not complete or comprehensive, however. \n\nI would love it if you could help keep them updated and give me feedback on how to improve them.\n\nThey cover more than just the 5 courses in the DL specialization, they also cover a few courses from their TensorFlow Developer Specialization (now a Professional Certificate), and a few courses from their NLP Specialization. There are a few parts where I just got overwhelmed and stopped taking notes, but I am going through all of those courses for a second time and I will be updating those parts as I go. I would also appreciate it if you could help fill in those parts.\n\nEDIT - Please suggest your edits as comments near the respective section if you have any! I'd love to make these notes the most comprehensive over time so they can help as much as possible!",

Early in my studies I liked the empirical/statistical subjects and when I finally heard about ML for the first time I knew that I wanted to deal with it professionally in the long run. So I took several online courses (including Professor Ng's Machine Learning Course on coursera and MITx's Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data on edX) and enrolled in a technical university parallel to my business psychology studies to take some additional math and computer science modules.\n\nI submitted my bachelor thesis a few weeks ago and am now a graduate of business psychology. So I started looking for a job right afterwards and to my surprise I was immediately hired by a large company based in Germany. Maybe I was just lucky, but I think the entry threshold wasn't as high as I thought it would be. I don't regret investing so much extra work in my data science education, I think it's just a small milestone and I'll be busy training myself for decades to come. Next year I'll start my Master's in Cognitive Science/AI and from there we'll see where I'll end up.\n\nI would like to wish you all good luck on your own paths!

    "postText": "90% of the truth about ML is inconvenient Hey guys! I once discussed with my past colleague that 90% of machine learning specialist work is, actually, engineering. That made me thinking, what other inconvenient or not obvious truths are there about our jobs? So I collected the ones that I experienced or have heard from the others. Some of them are my personal pain, some are just curious remarks. Don\u2019t take it too serious though.\n\nMaybe this post can help someone to get more insights about the field before diving into it. Or you can find yourself in some of the points, and maybe even write some more.\n\nOriginal is post is [here](https://irregularadel.substack.com/p/90-of-the-truth-about-ml-is-inconvenient).\n\n[Right?..](https://preview.redd.it/n92t3wfked671.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=acb652d066d813b5db77de4dc1f334f3d97e7496)\n\n# List of inconvenient truth about ML job:\n\n1. 90% of your job won\u2019t be about training neural networks.\u00a0\n2. 90% of ML specialists can\u2019t answer (hard) statistical questions.\n3. In 90% of cases, you will suffer from dirty and/or small datasets.\n4. 90% of model deployment is a pain in the ass. ( . \u2022\u0301 \\_\u0296 \u2022\u0300 .)\u00a0\n5. 90% of success comes from the data rather than from the models.\n6. For 90% of model training, you don\u2019t need a lot of super-duper GPUs\n7. There are 90% more men in Ml than women (at least what I see).\n8. In 90% of cases, your models will fail on real data.\n9. 90% of specialists had no ML-related courses in their Universities. (When I was diving into deep learning, there were around 0 courses even online)\n10. In large corporations, 90% of your time you will deal with a lot of security-related issues. (like try to use \u201cpip install something\u201d in some oil and gas company, hah)\n11. In startups, 90% of your time you will debug models based on users' complaints.\n12. In 90% of companies, there are no separate ML teams. But it\u2019s getting better though.\n13. 90% of stakeholders will be skeptical about ML.\n14. 90% of your questions are already on StackOverflow (or on some Pytorch forum).\n\nP.S. 90% of this note may not be true\n\nPlease, let me know if you want me to elaborate on this list - I can write more extensive stuff on each point. And also feel free to add more of these.\n\nThanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: someone pointed that meme with Anakin and Padme is about \"men know more than women\".

    "postTitle": "How NOT to learn Machine Learning",
    "postText": "How NOT to learn Machine Learning In this thread, I address common missteps when starting with Machine Learning.\n\nIn case you're interested, I wrote a longer article about this topic: [How NOT to learn Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-not-to-learn-machine-learning-80ce68f364b0?sk=7c2e65f478b874b8b091ceed0197456a), in which I also share a better way on how to start with ML.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2d3szz3xl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25d0e1d5c7eae5cedfa5f2f63ced200ce39fc47f\n\n**These three questions pop up regularly in my inbox:**\n\n* Should I start learning ML bottom-up by building strong foundations with Math and Statistics?\n* Or top-down by doing practical exercises, like participating in Kaggle challenges?\n* Should I pay for a course from an influencer that I follow?\n\n## Don\u2019t buy into shortcuts\n\nMy opinion differs from various social media influencers, which can allegedly teach you ML in a few weeks (you just need to buy their course).\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest with you:\n\n>There are no shortcuts in learning Machine Learning.\n\nThere are better and worse ways of starting learning it.\n\nThink about it \u2014 if there would exist a shortcut, then many would be profiting from Machine Learning, but they don\u2019t.\n\nMany use Machine Learning as a buzz word because it sells well.\n\nWriting and preaching about Machine Learning is much easier than actually doing it. That\u2019s also the main reason for a spike in social media influencers.\n\n# How long will you need to learn\u00a0it?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uc7jag7xl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8ac8051b6b380cd0053ef1f07ef70b7052e72f6\n\nIt really depends on your skill set and how quickly you\u2019ll be able to switch your mindset.\n\nMath and statistics become important later (much later). So it shouldn\u2019t discourage you if you\u2019re not proficient at it.\n\nMany Software Engineers are good with code but have trouble with a paradigm shift.\n\n>Machine Learning code rarely crashes, even when there\u2019re bugs. May that be in incorrect training set specification or by using an incorrect model for the\u00a0problem.\n\nI would say, by using a rule of thumb, you\u2019ll need 1-2 years of part-time studying to learn Machine Learning. Don\u2019t expect to learn something useful in just two weeks.\n\n# What do I mean by learning Machine Learning?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rdk22lo8xl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33f9eb8cc5511045e147818574c8b3045618c9e8\n\nI need to define what do I mean by \u201clearning Machine Learning\u201d as learning is a never-ending process.\n\n>As Socrates said: The more I learn, the less I realize I\u00a0know.\n\nThe quote above really holds for Machine Learning. I\u2019m in my 7th year in the field and I\u2019m constantly learning new things. You can always go deeper with ML.\n\n**When is it fair to say that you know Machine Learning?**\n\nIn my opinion, there are two cases:\n\n* In the first case, you use ML to solve a practical (non-trivial) problem that you couldn\u2019t solve otherwise. May that be a hobby project or in your work.\n* Someone is prepared to pay you for your services.\n\n**When is it NOT fair to say you know Machine Learning?**\n\nDon\u2019t be that guy that \u201cknows\u201d Machine Learning, because he trained a Neural Network, which (sometimes) correctly separates cats from dogs. Or that guy, who knows how to predict who would survive the Titanic disaster.\n\nMany follow a simple tutorial, which outlines just the cherry on top. There are many important things happening behind the scenes, for which you need time to study and understand.\n\nThe guys that \u201cknow ML\u201d above would get lost, if you would just slightly change the problem.\n\n# Money can buy books, but it can\u2019t buy knowledge\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzxcduu9xl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ac80b86ea53b29fb339fb99f14c327faab36c02\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this article, there is more and more educational content about Machine Learning available every day. That also holds for free content, which is many times on the same level as paid content.\n\nTo give an answer to the question: Should you buy that course from the influencer you follow?\n\n>Investing in yourself is never a bad investment, but I suggest you look at the free resources first.\n\n# Learn breadth-first, not depth-first\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4272vzazl461.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a779cfd3efa597090cea776b7be8e50c7bd050da\n\nI would start learning Machine Learning top-down.\n\nIt seems counter-intuitive to start learning a new field from high-level concepts and then proceed to the foundations. IMO this is a better way to learn it.\n\nWhy? Because when learning from the bottom-up, it\u2019s not obvious where do complex concepts from Math and Statistics fit into Machine Learning. It gets too abstract.\n\nMy advice is (if I put in graph theory terms):\n\n>Try to learn Machine Learning breadth-first, not depth-first.\n\nMeaning, don\u2019t go too deep into a certain topic, because you\u2019d get discouraged quickly. Eg. learning concepts of learning theory before training your first Machine Learning model.\n\nWhen you start learning ML, I also suggest you use multiple resources at the same time.\n\nTake multiple courses. You don\u2019t need to finish them. One instructor might present a certain concept better than another instructor.\n\nAlso don\u2019t focus just on courses. Try to learn the field more broadly. IMO finishing a course gives you a false feeling of progress. Eg. Maybe a course focuses too deeply on unimportant topics.\n\nWhile listening to the course, take some time and go through a few notebooks in [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks). This way you\u2019ll get a feel for the practical part of Machine Learning.\n\nEdit: Updated the rule of thumb estimate from 6 months to 1-2 years.\n\n&#x200B;",

GitHub repo link: [https://github.com/Emmanuel1118/Learn-ML-Basics](https://github.com/Emmanuel1118/Learn-ML-Basics)\n\nI want to create an easy to follow learning plan that relies entirely on online resources. I am a beginner myself and have seen a lot of GitHub repos that list many helpful resources, but I found it hard understanding where I should start and in what order I should do them (i.g. [https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/Machine-Learning-Tutorials](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/Machine-Learning-Tutorials). It's amazing and helped me a lot, but as a beginner I had no idea where to start and how to continue).\n\nAs of now, it contains the resources that I found most useful over the past year of learning, that helped me get from no experience with python to building CNNs and RNNs with TensorFlow and creating DNNs from scratch using my theoretical understanding. The repo describes a detailed learning plan that is meant to help anyone achieve that, as well as the knowledge to continue learning independently.\n\nI hope sharing this repo will help expand it further. If you think that you know how to add to it in way that will be easy to follow, please suggest it in the comments or in the issues. I think that we can create something very useful that will be of great help to beginners in the field.\n\n(I already posted it once here in a much earlier stage, now I refined it and added a lot and want to share it)",

I just don\u2019t know where to go or who to ask. \n\nFor some background information, I\u2019m a 27 year old student who is currently studying for her masters in artificial intelligence. Now to give some context, my background is entirely in education and philosophy. I applied for AI because I realised that teaching wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do and I didn\u2019t want to be stuck in retail for the rest of my life. \n\nBefore I started this course, the only Python I knew was the snake kind. Some background info on my mental health is that I have severe depression and anxiety that I am taking sertraline for and I\u2019m on a waiting list to start therapy. \n\nMy question is that since I\u2019ve started my masters, I\u2019ve struggled. One of the things that I\u2019ve struggled with the most is programming. Python is the language that my course has used for the AI course and I feel as though my command over it isn\u2019t great. I know this is because of a lack of practice and it scares me because the coding is the most basic part of this entire course. I feel so overwhelmed when I even try to attempt to code. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I don\u2019t know how I can find the discipline or motivation to make an effort and not completely fail my masters. \n\nWhen I started this course, I believed that this was my chance at a do over and to finally maybe have a career where I\u2019m not treated like some disposable trash. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this sounds as though I\u2019m rambling on, I\u2019m just struggling and any help or suggestions will be appreciated.",

Stop witch hunting: Yes, he has done some wrongdoings, but we do not need entire subreddit disparaging him.\n4. Prevent posts about/against him burying other educational posts in /r/lml: Perhaps the most important reason. I see the large portion of the /r/LML front page occupied about him .

I\u2019m going to leave out the basic things because there\u2019s enough posts about them, i\u2019m just focusing on what I found new or special in the book.\n\nI\u2019ve also put the insights into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/140&4&3K3uXPazkg4) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app (video** [**explanation**](https://youtu.be/AD0aFdRCskQ)**) like anki or** [**save all**](https://saveall.ai/) **for the things you learn** otherwise you\u2019ll just forget so much of what is important. Here\u2019s the takeaways:\n\n# Neural Network Training Fundamentals\n\n* Always **start** an ML project by **producing simple baselines**\n   * If is binary classification then could even be as simple as predicting the most common class in the training dataset\n   * Other baselines: linear regression, random forest, boosting etc\u2026\n* Then you can **use your baseline to clean your data** by looking at the datapoints it gets most incorrect and checking to see if they are actually classified correctly in the data\n* In general you can also **leverage your baselines** to **help debug** your models\n   * e.g. if you make your neural network 1 layer then it should be able to match the performance of a linear regression baseline, if it doesn\u2019t then you have a bug!\n   * e.g. if adding a feature improves the performance of linear regression then it should probably also improve the performance of your neural net unless you have a bug!\n* Hyperparameter optimisation can help a bit (especially for the learning rate) but in general there are default hyperparameters that can do quite well and so **closely** **optimising the hyperparameters should be one of the last things you try** rather than the first\n* **If you know something** about the problem then try to **inject it as an inductive bias into the training process**\n   * e.g. if some of your features are related in a sequential way then incorporate them into training separately using an RNN\n   * e.g. if you know the output should only be between -3 and 3 then use sigmoid to design the final layer so that it forces the output of the network to be in this range\n\n# Transfer Learning\n\n* Always use transfer learning if you can by finding a model pre-trained for a similar task and then fine-tune that model for your particular task\n   * e.g. see [huggingface](http://huggingface.co/) for help with this in NLP\n* **Gradual unfreezing** and **discriminative learning rates** work well when fine-tuning a transfer learned model\n   * **Gradual unfreezing** = freeze earlier layers and **train the later layers only**, then **gradually unfreeze** the earlier layers one by one\n   * **Discriminative learning rates** = having **different learning rates per layer of your network** (usually **earlier** **layers** have **smaller learning rates** than later layers)\n\n# Tricks to Deal with Overfitting\n\n* **Best way** to deal with **overfitting** is by getting **more data**. **Exhaust this first** before you start regularising with other methods\n* **Data augmentation** is really powerful and now possible with text as well as images:\n   * **Image** data augmentation -  crop, pad, squish and resize images\n   * **Text** data augmentation - negate words, replace words with similes, perturb word embeddings (nice github [repo](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) for this)\n* **Mixup regularisation** = create new data by averaging together training datapoints\n* **Backwards training (NLP only):** train an additional separate model that is **fed text backwards** and then **average the outputs** of your two models to get your final prediction\n\n# Other Tricks to Improve Performance\n\n* **Test time augmentation** = at test time, use the **average prediction** from many **augmented versions of the input** as your prediction rather than just the prediction from the true input\n* **1 cycle training** = when you increase and reduce the learning rate throughout training in a circular fashion (usually makes a **huge difference)**\n* **Learning rate finder algorithm** = algorithm that Fast AI provide to help you automatically discover roughly the best learning rate\n* **Never use one-hot encodings,** use **embeddings** instead, even in **tabular data**!\n* Using **AdamW** instead of **Adam** can help a little bit\n* **Lower precision training** can help and on [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) is just a simple flag you can set\n* For **regression problems** if you know the **output should be within a range** then its good to use **sigmoid** to force the neural net output to be within this range\n   * I.e. make the network output:  min\\_value + sigmoid(output) \\* (max\\_value - min\\_value)\n* **Clustering** your features can help you **identify which ones are the most redundant** and then removing the can help performance\n* **Label smoothing** = use 0.1 and 0.9 instead of 0 and 1 for label targets (can smoothen training)\n* **Don\u2019t dichotomise** your data, if your output is continuous then its better to train the network to predict continuous values rather than turning it into a classification problem\n* **Progressive resizing** = train model on smaller resolution images first, then increase resolution gradually (can speed up training a lot)\n* Strategically using **bottleneck layers** to force the network to form **more compact representations of the data** at different points can be helpful\n* Try using **skip connections** as they can help smooth out the loss surface\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know if you found this helpful and if there are any other training tricks you use that we should also know about?",

    "postText": "Don\u2019t Repeat These Mistakes with SQL SQL and Machine Learning have a few things in common. It\u2019s easy to start with one as it doesn\u2019t require a lot of coding. Also, code rarely crashes.\n\nI would argue that the fact that the SQL queries don\u2019t crash makes the Data Analysis even harder. How many datasets I\u2019ve extracted from the database, that turned out to have wrong or missing data? Many!\n\n# 1. Not knowing in what order queries execute\n\n[SQL query execution order](https://preview.redd.it/ncty0v0e7my51.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfa8f55df0828f3ef61534b78d8668bfc7615a3)\n\nSQL has a low barrier to entry. You start writing queries \u2014 use a JOIN here and there, do some grouping and you\u2019re already an expert (at least some people think so).\n\n**But does the so-called expert even know in what order do SQL queries execute?**\n\nSQL queries don\u2019t start with SELECT \u2014 they do in the editor when we write them, but the database doesn\u2019t start with SELECT.\n\nThe database starts executing queries with FROM and JOIN. That\u2019s why we can use fields from JOINed tables in WHERE.\n\nWhy can\u2019t we filter the result of GROUP BY in WHERE? Because GROUP BY executes after WHERE. Hence, the reason for HAVING.\n\nAt last, we come to SELECT. It selects which columns to include and defines which aggregations to calculate. Also, Window Functions execute here.\n\nThis explains why we get an error when we try to filter with the output of a Window Function in WHERE.\n\n# 2. What do Window Functions actually do?\n\n[Example of a transformation with a SUM Window Function](https://preview.redd.it/jxz0203i7my51.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04a2a8be6a2e73493a00137cddae123fae43ee6)\n\nWindow Functions seemed cryptic to me when I first encountered them. Why use Window Functions as GROUP BY can aggregate the data?\n\nWell, a Window Function (WF) simplifies many operations when designing queries:\n\n* WF allows access to the records right before and after the current record. See Lead and Lag functions.\n* WF can perform an additional aggregation on already aggregated data with GROUP BY. See the example in the image above, where I calculate sales all with a WF.\n* ROW\\_NUMBER WF enumerates the rows. We can also use it to remove duplicate records with it. Or to take a random sample.\n* As the name suggests WF can calculate statistics on a given window:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    sum(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID BY ts ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as cumulative_sum\n\nThe WF above would calculate the cumulative sum from the first record to the current record.\n\n**Where did I do a mistake with Window Functions?**\n\nI didn\u2019t take the time for a tutorial that would explain the basics and the power of Window Functions. Consequently, I avoided them and the queries became overcomplicated. Then bugs creep in.\n\n**Run the example**\n\nI got many requests from readers that would like to play with the example above. Now, you can run the example online in [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!15/9eecb7db59d16c80417c72d1e1f4fbf1/35342).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee [Don\u2019t Make These 5 Mistakes with SQL](https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-repeat-these-5-mistakes-with-sql-9f61d6f5324f?sk=a688d76b0fa3fc4c737552aedcbe5aad) for more.\n\nThanks for reading.

In the meantime, I was learning by doing side projects and courses.\n\nJust this week I started a new job in a company that is very experienced in ML. I think that I got lucky on technical interviews. I just got a task to basically run some data through the model they have, do the preprocessing etc. and I feel completely overwhelmed by the codebase and the task.\n\nI feel as if all I was learning was nothing and as if I am a complete beginner.

You might remember me from the Data Science Cheatsheet I posted a few months ago (here). The support from that was incredible, and I thought I\u2019d share an update. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve gone through a dozen interviews, ranging from FANG to startups to MBB, and updated the cheatsheet with topics I\u2019ve seen covered in actual interviews. \n\nImprovements include:\n\n* Added Time Series\n* Added Statistics\n* Added A/B Testing\n* Improved Distribution Section\n* Added Multi-class SVM\n* Added HMM \n* Miscellaneous Section\n* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!\n\nThese topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found **here**. \n\nI hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!\n\nCheers, AW\n\nGithub Repo: [https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet)",

    "postText": "We're building a platform to efficiently learn machine learning Online education is slow and frustrating. \n\nWe're building a graph-based platform for educational content that learns to recommend you the best content based on your knowledge and goals. It's faster, more engaging, and improves as you use it. \n\nWe are very early stage and are looking for signals of interest: If you want this to exist, [sign up here](https://learney.me).\n\nAnd can read more about what we're building here: [https://henry-pulver.medium.com/the-future-of-online-learning-for-knowledge-work-cb9608f9bc1a](https://henry-pulver.medium.com/the-future-of-online-learning-for-knowledge-work-cb9608f9bc1a)\n\nThe basic logic is:\n\n# Courses don't make sense online\n\nEducational content is almost always structured as a course. These siloed linear structures cannot take your current knowledge into account. While it's convenient for providers to package content this way, for the user this means:\n\n* Time wasted restudying material you already know\n* Starting content at the wrong difficulty level\n\n# Another way is now possible\n\nTwo huge changes mean a more efficient way of learning online has recently become possible. Enormous quantities of educational content is now freely available, and machine learning enables curation of content that is right for you. ***However, as everything is currently packaged as a course, a newly structured platform is required to deliver this.***\n\nWe are building a platform structured as a network, with nodes being concepts and edges being dependencies. Here's what that enables:\n\n* Association of each concept (node) with the best educational content from across the internet\n* Help you visualise a new area quickly based on the network structure\n* Find the best content for a specific idea quickly\n* Show you what you need to know before you're able to understand that idea\n* Increase knowledge retention through regular questioning on the topics that matter to you\n\nAnd here's an example of how it saves time when learning a topic you'll all know about, linear algebra: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[How Learney saves you time](https://preview.redd.it/xf6wflr1aqw61.png?width=2481&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1eec45517914ef84467f108a4e67169312f3912)\n\nRather than take the whole linear algebra course, Learney can compute the most efficient path you learning what you need to know. \n\n# Long term vision\n\nWe aim to have questions associated with each node for you to test your knowledge in that area, and apply techniques such as spaced repetition to maximise knowledge retention. We also aim to have associated coding exercises with datasets if relevant. \n\nWhile we are starting with machine learning, we envisage this platform being the central hub for online learning, allowing you to track your knowledge, find the best content for achieving your learning goals, and ensure knowledge retention.\n\nOverall we aim to build an adaptive learning system for online education.

All well and good, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have a complete grasp of the subject.\n\n**Test your skills by implementing a use case from scratch**. Without using any ready-made resources or instructions. From data collection, data preparation & understanding, modeling, training, optimization to a robust pipeline. Be able to explain and interpret what you have realized. **Try to visualize it and describe it to someone who is not an expert. Do this several times, and you will notice how what you have learned above will fuse into something unique and valuable**.\n\n(excerpt from my new book [THE AI THOUGHT BOOK](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Z4BWN1X))",

Basically, it's a project that's spoonfeed to you by the instructor though a cloud desktop. It's a short 1-2 hour tutorial, and you get a certificate. It's usually ten bucks.   [https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=guided+projects&index=prod\\_all\\_products\\_term\\_optimization&skills=Machine+Learning](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=guided+projects&index=prod_all_products_term_optimization&skills=Machine+Learning) \n\nI've just started to take Andrew Ng's machine learning course, so I decided to take one of the beginner machine learning projects. I took one about multiple linear regression .  [https://www.coursera.org/projects/scikit-learn-multiple-linear-regression?](https://www.coursera.org/projects/scikit-learn-multiple-linear-regression?)  Unlike the coursera course, it didn't go deep into the theory, and went straight to the applications. It was helpful, because it taught Python and its libraries, while the machine learning course only teaches Octave and MATLAB, and it reinforced what I learned in class. \n\nI wouldn't normally buy it for the ten dollar price, since it's very short. If you're just starting out like me, I highly recommend it while it's free. It's free until the 12th, and you have to add it to your cart, and then it should show it as 0 cents.",

I know how to apply machine learning tools in different contexts and I've run numerous large scale projects. Recently I've been studying discrete math and classical CS algorithms. It's amazing how much you can do with decades-old ideas! \n\nI was working on an NP-Hard problem and thought I'd have to come up with a complicated model to even get close to a solution. Instead, I find an old approach that was good enough for my purposes. The people who invented it had access to such weak computers that they had to be clever. \n\nIt's a shame that there's such a divide between the education of most DS and CS practitioners. I think the two fields could learn from each other.",

What kind of projects you want to work on. Where you want to spend much of your time (for example I will be doing NLP).\n3. Post that you can message privately to people who have similar intertests or whom you want to make a group with.\n4. We will proceed with groups of 5-8 people.\n5. Once you have decided to make a group, please let the moderators know.We will create separate channel for you.\n6. After people are divided into groups you can either follow and standard blueprint that I am creating that I am interested in, you can create your own discussing it with your group, take from another group etc.We will try to keep weekly live streams where one person from a group will coding something live for others to learn and ask doubts.Inter and Intra group collaboration processes to be decided yet.Link: [https://discord.gg/EsrDePp](https://discord.gg/EsrDePp)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----Original Post------Hi all, I am doing a code marathon for polishing my ML and DL skills. If you are a beginner and are done with some basic courses, this might be helpful for you. Some things you can expect from the marathon:\n\n* EDA on different datasets.\n* Preprocessing data for better performing models.\n* Experiments with plotting libraries and different mathematical graphs.\n* Simple statistics and probability experiments.\n* Traditional ML models from famous libraries like Scikit, Xgboost.\n* Experiments with Kaggle competitions.\n* Functions like backprop written using Numpy.\n* Deep neural nets trained on GCP/AWS.\n* E2E machine learning pipeline using Kubeflow on GCP/AWS.\n* and a lot more.\n\nLet me know if you want to tag along.

Also, I am looking for people to help with this, get in DMs if you have ideas.\n\nEdit2: Thanks guys for the overwhelming response. I was not expecting these many people being interested. I will create a discord server at night and have simple channels made for discussions and intros. I will work on a methodology on how to do this properly and better meanwhile, all suggestions are welcome. Will start coding on 1st of November. Really excited for this.\n\nEdit3: Hi guys, created this Discord channel: \\[removed\\] Feel free to join, there is nothing much there yet. Just introductions and collecting idea on how to do this better, frankly wasn't expecting these many responses. Feel think a little bit more about how to do this before we actually start coding form 1st Nov. Until then join the disco, Introduce yourselves. Happy learning!\n\nEdit4: Hi guys, We had a lot of people joining in so disabled the link for now. Will come up with some concrete processes first and then add more people soon.

I've been wanting to actively pursue Machine Learning and Data Science for more than a year now but haven't been consistent and usually forget after 3-4 days. \n\nThe challenge includes posting what you do on your social media handles so that you stay more committed to this challenge. After a few days, the habit sticks and you simply can't go to sleep without learning something. I've had a few very busy and tiring days too in these 27 days, but I've made sure I did something at least in those days. I'd strongly recommend anyone who's passionate about Machine Learning to take up this challenge. \n\nI post my challenge details in the blog below, on Github, on Twitter, and my projects on Linkedin.\nhttps://hitheshai.blogspot.com\n\nHere's a summary of how much I was able to learn because of this challenge in 25 Days. Also, getting best wishes from Josh Starmer on one of my Twitter posts (a scholar who runs Statquest channel on YouTube, one of the best in the genre) was a great deal of encouragement. \n\n(Note: In my version of this challenge, I don't necessarily have to code everyday because of college and other commitments. Some days, even watching a single YouTube video might be sufficient as long as I make some progress from the previous day.)\n\nCompleted two MOOCs on Coursera \n\u2022Machine Learning (Days 1-10) \n\u2022Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Part 1 of Deep Learning Specialization (Days 20-25)\n\nDid 2 mini-projects\n\u2022Clustering (Day 4) \n\u2022Anomaly Detection (Day 7) \n\nParticipated in a Kaggle competition (Boston House Price Prediction) and learnt useful tree based models and data cleaning techniques.

I call them \"*your daily dose of machine learning*\".\n\nHere's an ML interview question for you.\n\nWhat is high bias in deep learning and how do you know that your neural network has a high bias?\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f A high bias in deep learning means that your neural network is underfitting the training data. Which means that your neural network is not learning a complex enough model.\n\nAn example of this would be : you want to build a classifier that can separate between 2 classes. These 2 classes look like the image below.\n\nSo instead of learning a CIRCULAR boundary, your neural network will learn a LINEAR boundary.\n\nEmpirically, if your training accuracy is much lower than human-level accuracy then you have a high bias (or underfitting).\n\nPossible solution? Make your neural network more complex by adding more layers for example.\n\n[\\#deeplearning](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=deeplearning&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6827200616402571264) [\\#interviewquestions](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=interviewquestions&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6827200616402571264)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfs92uypike71.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b1ce6133e8098406feabdbeb3bc5b499b6b746",

All they care about is deep learning and neural networks and their practical implementations. They think that y=mx+b is all there is to linear regression as in fitting a line to the data. But what they don't realize is it's much more than that, not only it's an excellent machine learning algorithm but it also forms a basis to advanced algorithms such as ANNs. \n\nI've spoken with many data scientists and even though they know the formula y=mx+b, they don't know how to find the values of the slope(m) and the intercept(b). Please don't do this make sure you understand the underlying math behind linear regression and how it's derived before moving on to more advanced ML algorithms, and try using it for one of your projects where there's a co-relation between features and target. I guarantee that the results would be better than expected. Don't think of Linear Regression as a Hello World of ML but rather as an important pre-requisite for learning further.\n\nHope this post increases your awareness about Linear Regression and it's importance in Machine Learning.",

    "postText": "GPT-4 Will Be 500x Smaller Than People Think - Here Is Why &#x200B;\n\n[Number Of Parameters GPT-3 vs. GPT-4](https://preview.redd.it/yio0v3zqgyca1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2ee034ce7ed48c9adc1793bfdb495e0f0812609)\n\nThe rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.\n\nPeople are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That\u2019s a *trillion* with a \u201ct\u201d.\n\nThe often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.\n\nSure, OpenAI\u2019s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger \u2014 fast!\n\nBut this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).\n\n*Let\u2019s go!*\n\nTraining 100 Trillion Parameters\n\nThe creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \\[1\\].\n\nTraining a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.\n\nSo, where is this rumor coming from?\n\nThe Source Of The Rumor:\n\nIt turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.\n\nIn August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): \u201cFrom talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters\u201d.\n\nA the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.\n\nThings have changed a lot since then!\n\nTo understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.\n\nDeciding The Number Of Parameters:\n\nThe enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.\n\nIn practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.\n\n*But there\u2019s a catch!*\n\nMost research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.\n\nWith LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.\n\nTherefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.\n\nThis process can very noisy and the community\u2019s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.\n\nWhat People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs\n\nIn 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: \u201cScaling Laws For Neural Language Models\u201d.\n\nThey observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.\n\nSo far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.\n\n1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.\n2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.\n\nHence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \\[2\\].\n\nAnd that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.\n\nBut the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.\n\n*Read on to learn why!*\n\nWhat We know About Scaling Models Today\n\nIt turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.\n\nThis was published in DeepMind\u2019s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): \u201cTraining Compute-Optimal Large Language Models\u201d\n\nThe researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.\n\nThe findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.\n\nTo verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.\n\nChinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \\[3\\].\n\nThis was a great breakthrough!  \nThe model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.\n\n*So What Will Happen?*\n\nWhat GPT-4 Might Look Like:\n\nTo properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \\[1\\].\n\nSo, here is what GPT-4 could look like:\n\n* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data\n* \u200b[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound\n* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \\[4\\]\n* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails\u200b\n\nRegardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.\n\nWhatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.\n\nSuch exciting times to be alive!\n\nAs always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!\n\nWould you like to receive an article such as this one straight to your inbox every Thursday?

    "postText": "Want to learn ML by applying it to Games? I'll personally call you weekly and make sure you do it! Hi everyone, my name\u2019s Chris! I\u2019m a research software engineer with a focus on applying machine learning techniques to a variety of new inventions. I\u2019m also the co-founder and current co-lead of my company\u2019s machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) community of practice.\n\nIn my free time, I apply ML to games in many different ways. My projects so far mainly have to do with Old School Runescape (examples below but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here for today). I\u2019m here today because a few people have reached out to me recently about starting their own projects applying ML to various games and I think that\u2019s a great idea!! After all, the best way to learn is through implementation and why not implement something you care about? Not to mention, personal projects look great on any resume!\n\nThroughout my journey, I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m happiest when helping people out by thinking through their process with them and figuring out what comes next. I would really like to share my experience and expertise gained with anyone who is interested in making their own projects and learning much more about ML and its applications in the process. I also have a bunch of ideas for ML-game projects that I\u2019ll never have the time to implement myself which someone else might find invigorating.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m thinking of starting what I\u2019ll call the Chronic Coder Academy. I\u2019ll start with a few students who I personally call on a weekly basis for about 30 minutes to an hour to discuss their new or ongoing ML projects - weekly todos, potential resources and next steps. I personally think it\u2019d help keep people accountable on their personal journey learning ML and also keep them motivated if I direct them well instead of being lost in the rough sea of ML/AI.\n\nThis is targeted at people who care about games and also want to learn more about ML through application. Your age, race, gender, ethnicity, etc mean nothing to me but you have to be passionate about what you do and hopefully converse well enough in English. Everything you make is completely your own, no matter how much advice or guidance I end up giving. Oh and also, it\u2019s completely free (before anyone asks). I\u2019m really in this to better expose myself to different applications and ideas plus I truly enjoy watching people learn especially from interesting use cases like these. If they will allow me, I might use their projects as examples for teaching people more about specific ML concepts in the future. All that said, please fill out this survey if you\u2019re interested: [https://forms.gle/W37tzNFsTCFXGEwMA](https://forms.gle/W37tzNFsTCFXGEwMA)\n\nIf this isn\u2019t for you at this point in your life, feel free to join our discord! This applies regardless of who you are, what you do or what your experience level is. It\u2019s an amazing community of ML experts and curious students alike who also happen to share a love for games. We could always use more experts to help anyone in need but also it\u2019s a place to learn if you\u2019re doing your own applied ML project and aren\u2019t sure who to go to. Join us here: [https://discord.gg/ZummSXK](https://discord.gg/ZummSXK)\n\nOh and if you\u2019re looking for a job sometime soon and worried about a project involving games not being a series enough topic to get hired, I previously did some asking around: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tU2GxQ3SZJVjV8\\_A\\_PwJBlrQf1tGO1mN0n9YIYLnlSg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tU2GxQ3SZJVjV8_A_PwJBlrQf1tGO1mN0n9YIYLnlSg/edit?usp=sharing). Looks like most professionals agree that ML applied to games can be as serious a topic as any other within the ML field.\n\nWhew that was a long piece... Thank you for reading if you've made it this far!\n\nor **TL;DR** \\- I want to help people learn ML by applying it to games. I intend to personally call them on a weekly basis to discuss progress and next steps. Fill out the form above if you\u2019re interested!\n\nMy Personal Projects:\n\n**Bot Classification** \\- currently in progress, classification techniques for the automated detection and reporting of bots: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk4Yahv2lek&list=PLX9loFun2zNkqwEk3abeMzZnVlT0YPxkp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk4Yahv2lek&list=PLX9loFun2zNkqwEk3abeMzZnVlT0YPxkp)\n\n**Grand Exchange Prediction** \\- time series analysis to predict the future prices of items in the grand exchange: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5TmBcpgm7k&list=PLX9loFun2zNmri7jHhLs7NV76wcGRzI45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5TmBcpgm7k&list=PLX9loFun2zNmri7jHhLs7NV76wcGRzI45)\n\n**Cow Compliments** \\- computer vision to detect cows on the screen in real time, walk over to them and compliment them for the lulz: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oW7jDyIufE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oW7jDyIufE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: Firstly, THANK YOU FOR MY FIRST GOLD.\n\nOn the topic of when you can expect a response, I'll read through every submission by the end of the week and I'll let you guys know who I decide to start off working with by this weekend (05/10/2020). Probably a max of 5 individuals who I will reach out to once chosen.\n\nThe goal is to have a variety of different projects each from different games the individuals are passionate about. This is to hopefully allow for a broader scope of projects that ALL of you can contribute to as well. I plan to make a discord text channel for each game that we're going to be working on. There, we can all discuss ideas, issues and breakthroughs of applying ML to the chosen game. To be clear, these channels are not just for the main project that we'll be working on with the CCA Fellows (which you can contribute as well) but also for your own project ideas that you can work through alongside other ongoing projects that are different but still focused on that specific game.  So please join the discord if you're interested with working on these projects!\n\nI know I will not be able to reach all of you due to the overwhelming response (once again, thank you so much!). However, I still definitely believe in the power of learning through application. Therefore, even if I can't get to you all personally, I hope you still get started on your own by either contributing to the main projects or with your own ML+Game projects. If you do, please keep us up to date as well on the channels we'll create for the games. We'll make sure to check in and, even if it's not a long personal call, that'll definitely still be a way to keep you accountable and continuously learning!",

It's special in the sense that after applying the said transform it does not change direction but only gets scaled (multiplied by a scalar value) by the eigenvalue.  \n\n\n\ud83d\udd28 Each eigenvector comes with a corresponding scalar called the eigenvalue. Breaking a matrix M into its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors is called eigendecomposition.  \n\n\n\ud83d\udd2d The word \"Eigenvector\" comes from \"eigen\" in German where it means \"its own\". It was originally used to study rigid body motion and in the discovery of principal axes. However, nowadays it has found its way into a wide array of applications from my favorite: principal component analysis, differential equations, and problems in physics and chemistry relating to wave transport and molecular orbitals.  \n\n\n\ud83c\udfad Another one of the classical applications is the Eigenfaces project for facial recognition. Eigenfaces decompose a face as a composition of face templates (basis) called eigenfaces. Imagine N eigenfaces E\\_1, ..., E\\_n when given a new face F it can be written as a composition of each of these N eigenfaces for example: F = (10% of E\\_1 + 55% of E\\_2 + 35% of E\\_3). Each eigenface would represent a meaningful feature in the high-dimensional space of faces.  \n\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nIf you like such content and would like to steer the topics I cover, suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments.",

    "postTitle": "Best practices for learning Machine Learning",
    "postText": "Best practices for learning Machine Learning Hi all,\n\nI want to compile a list of best practices for learning data science. A list of things that you'd tell yourself if you could go back in time to when you were starting from scratch. What is relevant, what is not.\n\nI have started a list, but I want to discuss it with the community and curate it with your help.\n\n1. Before you start, get a solid math and prob/stats core. It's not so important to be able to proof a theorem, but you should know your way around matrices and vectors and intuitively undersand probabilities\n2. Learn either Python or R and their data handling packages (Pandas and Numpy for Python, data.table/dplyr for R) and learn them well. Most of your time will be spent working with these tools\n3. Try to learn code good practices. This could take a whole post, a quick summary would be: use descriptive names for variables, columns and functions; don't repeat code (use functions instead); understandable code is better than compact one (10 lines everybody understands > 2 lines nobody understands); don't overoptimize your code at the start, but know where the bottlenecks are in case you need it to scale\n4. You don't need to learn all fancy models out there. For basic tasks linear regression is surprisingly effective. XGBoost is one of the most effective models for tabular data. Only learn/use neural nets for image, NLP or some other very specific domain\n5. Once you know the basics and understand them well, it's mostly about doing projects\n6. When learning a new topic, doing tutorial projects or understanding projects done by others is very helpful\n7. You can learn everything online for free. But paying may give you other things other than knowledge (credentials, a class of peers, in some courses better resouces)\n8. Explaining your work to others is a great way to consolidate your knowledge\n9. Nobody gets it right the first time. Trial and error is the way to go, especially on fields like this where there is no one exact solution\n10. The internet is full of helpful and generous people, if you're struggling with something search and if you don't find the answers, ask in the forums (reddit or stackoverflow)\n11. Don't focus only on the purely technical, try to understand what is really behind the problems you're modeling\n\nWhat do you think is missing from the list?\n\nWhat would you add?  \n\n\nEdit:  \nThanks to all!  \nI've written [blog post adding some suggestions from the comments and expanding a bit on some points](https://oriolcosp.com/13-essential-tips-for-learning-machine-learning-and-data-science/). I hope it's helpful to you!",

    "postText": "Study Plan for Learning Data Science Over the Next 12 Months [D] In this thread, I address a study plan for 2021.\n\nIn case you're interested, I wrote a whole article about this topic: [Study Plan for Learning Data Science Over the Next 12 Months](https://www.datasource.ai/en/data-science-articles/study-plan-for-learning-data-science-over-the-next-12-months)\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/emg20nzhet661.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf09e4dc5e82ba2fd7b57c706ba2873be57fe8de\n\nWe are ending 2020 and it is time to make plans for next year, and one of the most important plans and questions we must ask is what do we want to study?, what do we want to enhance?, what changes do we want to make?, and what is the direction we are going to take (or continue) in our professional careers?.\n\nMany of you will be starting on the road to becoming a data scientist, in fact you may be evaluating it, since you have heard a lot about it, but you have some doubts, for example about the amount of job offers that may exist in this area, doubts about the technology itself, and about the path you should follow, considering the wide range of options to learn.\n\nI\u2019m a believer that we should learn from various sources, from various mentors, and from various formats. By sources I mean the various virtual platforms and face-to-face options that exist to study. By mentors I mean that it is always a good idea to learn from different points of view and learning from different teachers/mentors, and by formats I mean the choices between books, videos, classes, and other formats where the information is contained.\n\nWhen we extract information from all these sources we reinforce the knowledge learned, but we always need a guide, and this post aims to give you some practical insights and strategies in this regard.\n\nTo decide on sources, mentors and formats it is up to you to choose. It depends on your preferences and ease of learning: for example, some people are better at learning from books, while others prefer to learn from videos. Some prefer to study on platforms that are practical (following online code), and others prefer traditional platforms: like those at universities (Master\u2019s Degree, PHDs or MOOCs). Others prefer to pay for quality content, while others prefer to look only for free material. That\u2019s why I won\u2019t give a specific recommendation in this post, but I\u2019ll give you the whole picture: **a study plan**.\n\nTo start you should consider the time you\u2019ll spend studying and the depth of learning you want to achieve, because if you find yourself without a job you could be available full time to study, which is a huge advantage. On the other hand, if you are working, you\u2019ll have less time and you\u2019ll have to discipline yourself to be able to have the time available in the evenings, mornings or weekends. Ultimately, the important thing is to meet the goal of learning and perhaps dedicating your career to this exciting area!\n\nWe will divide the year into quarters as follows\n\n* **First Quarter**: Learning the Basics\n* **Second Quarter**: Upgrading the Level: Intermediate Knowledge\n* **Third Quarter**: A Real World Project \u2014 A Full-stack Project\n* **Fourth Quarter**: Seeking Opportunities While Maintaining Practice\n\n# First Quarter: Learning the Basics\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7t9bthket661.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ad29cb43618e7acf793259243aa5a60a8535f0a\n\nIf you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study of the bases. It could be something like: From January 1 to March 30, 2021 as deadline. During this period you will study the following:\n\n## A programming language that you can apply to data science: Python or R.\n\nWe recommend Python due to the simple fact that approximately 80% of data science job offers ask for knowledge in Python. That same percentage is maintained with respect to the real projects you will find implemented in production. And we add the fact that Python is multipurpose, so you won\u2019t \u201cwaste\u201d your time if at some point you decide to focus on web development, for example, or desktop development. This would be the first topic to study in the first months of the year.\n\n## Familiarize yourself with statistics and mathematics.\n\nThere is a big debate in the data science community about whether we need this foundation or not. I will write a post later on about this, but the reality is that you **DO** need it, but **ONLY** the basics (at least in the beginning). And I want to clarify this point before continuing.\n\nWe could say that data science is divided in two big fields: Research on one side and putting Machine Learning algorithms into production on the other side. If you later decide to focus on Research then you are going to need mathematics and statistics in depth (very in depth). If you are going to go for the practical part, the libraries will help you deal with most of it, under the hood. It should be noted that most job offers are in the practical part.\n\nFor both cases, and in this first stage you will only need the basics of:\n\n* **Statistics (with Python and NumPy)**\n\n1. Descriptive statistics\n2. Inferential Statistics\n3. Hypothesis testing\n4. Probability\n\n* **Mathematics (with Python and NumPy)**\n\n1. Linear Algebra (For example: SVD)\n2. Multivariate Calculus\n3. Calculus (For example: gradient descent)\n\n**Note**: We recommend that you study Python first before seeing statistics and mathematics, because the challenge is to implement these statistical and mathematical bases with Python. Don\u2019t look for theoretical tutorials that show only slides or statistical and/or mathematical examples in Excel/Matlab/Octave/SAS and other different to Python or R, it gets very boring and impractical! You should choose a course, program or book that teaches these concepts in a practical way and using Python. Remember that Python is what we finally use, so you need to choose well. **This advice is key so you don\u2019t give up on this part, as it will be the most dense and difficult**.\n\nIf you have these basics in the first three months, you will be ready to make a leap in your learning for the next three months.\n\n# Second Quarter: Upgrading the Level: Intermediate Knowledge\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1y55vynet661.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3e12bb112943025c39a8975faf4d64514df275\n\nIf you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the intermediate level. It could be something like: From April 1 to June 30, 2021 as deadline.\n\nNow that you have a good foundation in programming, statistics and mathematics, it is time to move forward and learn about the great advantages that Python has for applying data analysis. For this stage you will be focused on:\n\n## Data science Python stack\n\nPython has the following libraries that you should study, know and practice at this stage\n\n* **Pandas**: for working with tabular data and make in-depth analysis\n* **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: for data visualization\n\nPandas is the in-facto library for data analysis, it is one of the most important (if not the most important) and powerful tools you should know and master during your career as a data scientist. Pandas will make it much easier for you to manipulate, cleanse and organize your data.\n\n## Feature Engineering\n\nMany times people don\u2019t go deep into Feature Engineering, but if you want to have Machine Learning models that make good predictions and improve your scores, spending some time on this subject is invaluable!\n\nFeature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data using data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself. To achieve the goal of good feature engineering you must know the different techniques that exist, so it is a good idea to at least study the main ones.\n\n## Basic Models of Machine Learning\n\nAt the end of this stage you will start with the study of Machine Learning. This is perhaps the most awaited moment! This is where you start to learn about the different algorithms you can use, which particular problems you can solve and how you can apply them in real life.\n\nThe Python library we recommend you to start experimenting with ML is: scikit-learn. *However it is a good idea that you can find tutorials where they explain the implementation of the algorithms (at least the simplest ones) from scratch with Python, since the library could be a \u201c****Black Box****\u201d and you might not understand what is happening under the hood. If you learn how to implement them with Python, you can have a more solid foundation*.\n\nIf you implement the algorithms with Python (without a library), you will put into practice everything seen in the statistics, mathematics and Pandas part.\n\nThese are some recommendations of the algorithms that you should at least know in this initial stage\n\n* **Supervised learning**\n   * Simple Linear Regression\n   * Multiple Linear Regression\n   * K-nearest neighbors (KNN)\n   * Logistic Regression\n   * Decision Trees\n   * Random Forest\n* **Unsupervised Learning**\n   * K-Means\n   * PCA\n\n**Bonus**: if you have the time and you are within the time ranges, you can study these others\n\n* **Gradient Boosting Algorithms**\n   * GBM\n   * XGBoost\n   * LightGBM\n   * CatBoost\n\n**Note**: do not spend more than the 3 months stipulated for this stage. Because you will be falling behind and not complying with the study plan. We all have shortcomings at this stage, it is normal, go ahead and then you can resume some concepts that did not understand in detail. The important thing is to have the basic knowledge and move forward!\n\n*If at least you succeed to study the mentioned algorithms of supervised and unsupervised learning, you will have a very clear idea of what you will be able to do in the future*. So don\u2019t worry about covering everything, remember that it is a process, and ideally you should have some clearly established times so that you don\u2019t get frustrated and feel you are advancing.\n\nSo far, here comes your \u201ctheoretical\u201d study of the basics of data science. Now we\u2019ll continue with the practical part!\n\n# Third Quarter: A Real World Project \u2014 A Full-stack Project\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrn783vqet661.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=664061b3d33b34979b74b10b9f8a3d0f7b8b99ee\n\nIf you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the intermediate level. It could be something like: From July 1 to September 30, 2021 as deadline.\n\nNow that you have a good foundation in programming, statistics, mathematics, data analysis and machine learning algorithms, it is time to move forward and put into practice all this knowledge.\n\nMany of these suggestions may sound out of the box, but believe me they will make a big difference in your career as a data scientist.\n\n## The first thing is to create your web presence:\n\n* *Create a Github (or GitLab) account, and learn Git*. Being able to manage different versions of your code is important, you should have version control over them, not to mention that having an active Github account is very valuable in demonstrating your true skills. On Github, you can also set up your Jupyter Notebooks and make them public, so you can show off your skills as well. This is mine for example: [https://github.com/danielmoralesp](https://github.com/danielmoralesp)\n* *Learn the basics of web programming*. The advantage is that you already have Python as a skill, so you can learn Flask to create a simple web page. Or you can use a template engine like Github Pages, Ghost or Wordpress itself and create your online portfolio.\n* *Buy a domain with your name*. Something like myname.com, myname.co, myname.dev, etc. This is invaluable so you can have your CV online and update it with your projects. There you can make a big difference, showing your projects, your Jupyter Notebooks and showing that you have the practical skills to execute projects in this area. There are many front-end templates for you to purchase for free or for payment, and give it a more personalized and pleasant look. Don\u2019t use free sub-domains of Wordpress, Github or Wix, it looks very unprofessional, make your own. Here is mine for example: [https://www.danielmorales.dev/](https://www.danielmorales.dev/)\n\n## Choose a project you are passionate about and create a Machine Learning model around it.\n\nThe final goal of this third quarter is to create **ONE** project, that you are passionate about, and that is **UNIQUE** among others. It turns out that there are many typical projects in the community, such as predicting the Titanic Survivors, or predicting the price of Houses in Boston. Those kinds of projects are good for learning, but not for showing off as your **UNIQUE** projects.\n\nIf you are passionate about sports, try predicting the soccer results of your local league. If you are passionate about finance, try predicting your country\u2019s stock market prices. If you are passionate about marketing, try to find someone who has an e-commerce and implement a product recommendation algorithm and upload it to production. If you are passionate about business: make a predictor of the best business ideas for 2021 :)\n\nAs you can see, you are limited by your passions and your imagination. ***In fact,*** ***those are the two keys for you to do this project: Passion and Imagination***.\n\nHowever don\u2019t expect to make money from it, you are in a learning stage, you need that algorithm to be deployed in production, make an API in Flask with it, and explain in your website how you did it and how people can access it. This is the moment to shine, and at the same time it\u2019s the moment of the greatest learning.\n\nYou will most likely face obstacles, if your algorithm gives 60% of Accuracy after a huge optimization effort, it doesn\u2019t matter, finish the whole process, deploy it to production, try to get a friend or family member to use it, and that will be the goal achieved for this stage: **Make a Full-stack Machine Learning project.**\n\nBy full-stack I mean that you did all the following steps:\n\n* You got the data from somewhere (scrapping, open data or API)\n* You did a data analysis\n* You cleaned and transformed the data\n* You created Machine Learning Models\n* You deployed the best model to production for other people to use.\n\nThis does not mean that this whole process is what you will always do in your daily job, but it does mean that you will know every part of the pipeline that is needed for a data science project for a company. You will have a unique perspective!\n\n# Fourth Quarter: Seeking Opportunities While Maintaining Practice\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qd0osystet661.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da456b15985b2793041256f5e45bca99a23b51a\n\nIf you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the final level. It could be something like: From October 1 to December 31, 2021 as deadline.\n\nNow you have theoretical and practical knowledge. You have implemented a model in production. The next step depends on you and your personality. Let\u2019s say you are an entrepreneur, and you have the vision to create something new from something you discovered or saw an opportunity to do business with this discipline, so it\u2019s time to start planning how to do it. If that\u2019s the case, obviously this post won\u2019t cover that process, but you should know what the steps might be (or start figuring them out).\n\nBut if you are one of those who want to get a job as a data scientist, here is my advice.\n\n## Getting a job as a data scientist\n\n>*\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a job as fast as you think, if you keep thinking the same way\u201d.Author*\n\nIt turns out that all people who start out as data scientists imagine themselves working for the big companies in their country or region. Or even remote. It turns out that if you aspire to work for a large company like data scientist you will be frustrated by the years of experience they ask for (3 or more years) and the skills they request.\n\nLarge companies don\u2019t hire Juniors (or very few do), precisely because they are already large companies. They have the financial muscle to demand experience and skills and can pay a commensurate salary (although this is not always the case). The point is that if you focus there you\u2019re going to get frustrated!\n\nHere we must return to the following advise: ***\u201cYou need creativity to get a job in data science\u201d***.\n\nLike everything else in life we have to start at different steps, in this case, from the beginning. Here are the scenarios\n\n* *If you are working in a company and in a non-engineering role you must demonstrate your new skills to the company you are working for*. If you are working in the customer service area, you should apply it to your work, and do for example, detailed analysis of your calls, conversion rates, store data and make predictions about it! If you can have data from your colleagues, you could try to predict their sales! This may sound funny, but it\u2019s about how creatively you can apply data science to your current work and how to show your bosses how valuable it is and **EVANGELIZE** them about the benefits of implementation. You\u2019ll be noticed and they could certainly create a new data related department or job. And you already have the knowledge and experience. The key word here is **Evangelize**. Many companies and entrepreneurs are just beginning to see the power of this discipline, and it is your task to nurture that reality.\n* *If you are working in an area related to engineering, but that is not data science*. Here the same applies as the previous example, but you have some advantages, and that is that you could access the company\u2019s data, and you could use it for the benefit of the company, making analyses and/or predictions about it, and again **EVANGELIZING** your bosses your new skills and the benefits of data science.\n* *If you are unemployed (or do not want, or do not feel comfortable following the two examples above)*, you can start looking outside, and what I recommend is that you look for technology companies and / or startups where they are just forming the first teams and are paying some salary, or even have options shares of the company. Obviously here the salaries will not be exorbitant, and the working hours could be longer, but remember that you are in the learning and practice stage (just in the first step), so you can not demand too much, you must land your expectations and fit that reality, and stop pretending to be paid $ 10,000 a month at this stage. But, depending of your country $1.000 USD could be something very interesting to start this new career. Remember, you are a Junior at this stage.\n\n***The conclusion is: don\u2019t waste your time looking at and/or applying to offers from big companies, because you will get frustrated. Be creative, and look for opportunities in smaller or newly created companies***.\n\n## Learning never stops\n\nWhile you are in that process of looking for a job or an opportunity, which could take half of your time (50% looking for opportunities, 50% staying in practice), you have to keep learning, you should advance to concepts such as Deep Learning, Data Engineer or other topics that you feel were left loose from the past stages or focus on the topics that you are passionate about within this group of disciplines in data science.\n\nAt the same time you can choose a second project, and spend some time running it from end-to-end, and thus increase your portfolio and your experience. If this is the case, try to find a completely different project: if the first one was done with Machine Learning, let this second one be done with Deep learning. If the first one was deployed to a web page, that this second one is deployed to a mobile platform. Remember, creativity is the key!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe are at an ideal time to plan for 2021, and if this is the path you want to take, start looking for the platforms and media you want to study on. Get to work and don\u2019t miss this opportunity to become a data scientist in 2021!\n\nNote: we are building a private community in Slack of data scientist, if you want to join us write to the email: [support@datasource.ai](mailto:support@datasource.ai)\n\nI hope you enjoyed this reading! you can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/daniel_moralesp) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielmorales1/)\n\nThank you for reading!",

[https://github.com/polywock/text2gender](https://github.com/polywock/text2gender)\n\nEDIT2: Yikes, I made a pretty dumb mistake. Wrap it up folks. This model is very stupid. The testing data was USED to calculate a masculinity map that is essential to getting the features. This is probably overfitted garbage. A lesson to you all on behalf, never use the testing data for anything. Sorry folks. I'll try salvage it, and update you guys on the actual accuracy.\n\nEDIT3: Okay, crisis averted. The problem wasn't that big. I had to create 3 separate datasets. Training, testing, and prelim. The prelim dataset is solely used to generate a masculinity map, which is used to get a total masculinity score, a feature of the model. Results are mostly similar. Tbh, it probably didn't even matter that much.\n\nI still wouldn't trust this model for real world data because all training, testing, and prelim data is from AskWomen and AskMen. Next step is testing on data outside of this bubble.\n\nEDIT4: Okay, it seems to hold up on non-AskMen/AskWomen subreddits.\n\nEDIT5: Just to clarify why I thought the model was faulty. I found men/women through AskMen/AskWomen. And used the Pushshift API (god bless them) to query their posts from other subreddits like AskReddit. The API has a \"author=user1,user2,user3,etc\" parameter you can use to get only comments from specific users. I tested the accuracy and it was 50%. For binary classification, that means it was worthless. I freaked out and tried to find the problem. I found a minor problem and just assumed that it was a much bigger problem that it actually was. But, I later realized I was using the API wrong. I was using \"authors=\", instead of \"author=\". So, I was not filtering by specific users. Essentially getting back random posts, hence the 50% accuracy.",

And I am glad to share that today I have completed my [**#100daysofcode**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=%23100daysofcode) challenge.\n\n**Task Taken:** Create a [**GIT repository**](https://github.com/rj425/ML-Coursera/) containing all the programming exercises written from scratch in Python for the Coursera course called \"Machine Learning\" by Adjunct Professor Andrew Ng at Stanford University.\n\n* Written in Python3 using Jupyter Notebook.\n* Explains the mathematical derivations in detail.\n* Discusses a few feature engineering techniques.\n* Mainly uses Pandas and Numpy library.\n* Zero use of Sklearn and like libraries.\n\nYou can find the entire list of kernels [here.](https://github.com/rj425/ML-Coursera/blob/master/README.md) My personal favourite is [this one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rj425/ML-Coursera/blob/master/Exercise-6/ex6.ipynb).\n\nI personally feel the combination of the actual course and this repository would make a great guide for ML beginners who prefer Python over R. It is a collection of all the other supporting research papers and lectures I have used to get an in-depth understanding of various ML techniques...\n\nHope this helps somebody! :)",

I self-studied calculus, linear algebra, and a hint of probability. Andrew Ng was the one who taught me all the fundamentals. Yannic Kilcher helped me read my first papers.\n\nAfter learning the basics, I emailed literally every ML professor in Chicago and prayed for a position. I landed on a fantastic lab and was mentored through the scientific aspect of the field. This year I then started my own project combining Neural O/SDEs to generate videos.

Kaggle competitions and learning paths\n\nWhich of these would be best option considering that I would be joining a Masters course in CS next fall with a specialization in ML and would like to bridge the gap between my ML knowledge which is basic and the rigorous requirements for the coursework and thesis work of the Masters. \n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

    "postText": "Four books I swear by for AI/ML I\u2019ve seen a lot of bad \u201cHow to get started with ML\u201d posts throughout the internet. I\u2019m not going to claim that I can do any better, but I\u2019ll try. \n\nBefore I start, I\u2019m going to say that I\u2019m highly opinionated: I strongly believe that an ML practitioner should know theoretical fundamentals through and through. I\u2019m a research assistant, so these recommendations are biased to my experiences. As such, this post does not apply to those who want to use off the shelf ML algorithms, trained or otherwise, for SWE tasks. These books are overkill if all you need is sklearn for some business task and you aren\u2019t interested in peeling back a level of abstraction. I\u2019m also going to assume that you know your Calc, Linear Algebra and Statistics down cold.\n\nI\u2019m going to start by saying that I don\u2019t care about your tech stack: I\u2019ve been wrong to think that Python or R is the best way to go. The most talented ML engineer I know(who was my professor) does not know Python. \n\nIntroduction to Algorithms by CLRS: I know what you\u2019re thinking: this looks like a bait and switch. However, knowing how to solve deterministic computational problems well goes a long way. CLRS do a fantastic job at rigorously teaching you how to think algorithmically. As the book ends, the reader learns to appreciate the nature of P and NP problems, and learns a sense of the limits of computability. \n\nArtificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach: This books is still one of my all time favorites because it feels like a survey of AI. Newer editions have an expanded focus on Deep Learning, but I love this book because it highlights how classic AI techniques(like backtracking for CSPs) help deal with NP hard problems. In many ways, it feels like a natural progression of CLRS, because it deals with a whole new slew of problems from scheduling to searching against an adversary.\n\nPattern Classification: This is the best Machine Learning book I\u2019ve ever read. I prefer this book over ESL because of the narrative it presents. The book starts with an ideal scenario in which a distribution and its parameters are known to make predictions, and then slowly removes parts of the ideal scenario until the reader is left with a very real world set of limitations upon which inference must be made. Interestingly enough, I don\u2019t think the words \u201cMachine Learning\u201d ever come up in the book(though I might be wrong).\n\nDeep Learning: Ian Goodfellow et al really made a gold standard textbook in my opinion. It is technically rigorous yet intuitive. I have nothing to add that hasn\u2019t already been said.\n\nArXiv: I know that I said four books but beyond these texts, my best resource is ArXiv for bleeding edge Deep Learning. Keep in mind that ArXiv isn\u2019t rigorously reviewed so exercise ample caution.\n\nI hope these 4 + 1 resources help you in your journey.",

Let me expand on that.\n\n1. AI applications are multiplying like mushrooms, which is awesome\n2. As a result, more and more people are turning to the dark side, joining the AI world, as I did\n3. The problem? Developers focus only on AI, cleaning up datasets and training their models. Almost no one has a background in hardware, compilers, computing, cloud, etc\n4. The result? Developers spend a lot of hours improving the accuracy and performance of their software, and all their hard work risks being undone by the wrong choice of hardware-software coupling\n\nThis problem bothered me for a long time, so with a couple of buddies at [Nebuly](https://nebuly.ai/) (all ex MIT, ETH and EPFL), we put a lot of energy into an\u00a0**open-source library**\u00a0called\u00a0**nebullvm**\u00a0to make DL compiler technology accessible to any developer, even for those who know nothing about hardware, as I did.\n\nHow does it work? It\u00a0**speeds up your DL models by \\~5-20x**\u00a0by testing the best DL compilers out there and selecting the optimal one to best couple your AI model with your machine (GPU, CPU, etc.). All this in just a few lines of code.\n\nThe library is open source and you can find it here\u00a0[https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm).\n\nPlease leave a star on GitHub for the hard work in building the library :) It's a simple act for you, a big smile for us.

I have a cool lecture about the advances in Academia in automatic 3D modeling, the lecture is called \"From 2D to 3D with AI\". I usually teach it at conferences and machine learning courses. Now because of Corona, there is less teaching, so I thought of offering it to the community here :) If there will be 20+ redditors who are interested in the lecture we will make it happen. Feel free to DM me, or leave your info here and we will take it from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edited\\]\n\nHey all, since I see there is a lot of interest already, please fill-out the form so that I would know how to prepare the lecture and at what time: [https://forms.gle/wSXexXSBj5e5267G8](https://forms.gle/wSXexXSBj5e5267G8)\n\nThere is no need to comment anymore or dm me, it is just filling out my inbox lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edited 2\\]\n\nWell, this is kind of amazing, I was expecting for 20-50 people maximum, there are currently 232 people registered from literally all over the world. I will probably need to start a group somewhere to manage this. There might be several lectures for different technical backgrounds and time zones. I am still thinking of the best approach. Will send updates via email once the plan is set.\n\nIn the meantime, still accepting registration, so fill free to fill the form with your details to stay in the loop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edited 3\\]\n\nSo, following this amazing and unexpected turn, 329 people registered (!!!) from all over the world. This is too many people for one zoom event :P\n\nI have opened a sub-reddit manage all event details and share all the information. In this sub everyone can also discuss about anything regarding image processing, 3D modelling and AI:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/2D3DAI/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2D3DAI/)\n\nCurrently there are two events scheduled, one for the eastern hemisphere and one for the western - they are stickied so you can easily find them. I will do the same lecture twice so that people from different timezones could participate, since we truly have people from all over the world :) This lecture will not require technical background in the field.\n\nFor the more technically advanced people (almost half the registered have DL background) - we will probably have another set of 2 lectures. I just want to start this first round, see how it goes and take it from there.\n\nSeeing this amazing interest from people, I have started putting into plan more free lectures in deep learning on other subjects from other guest lecturers. We will take it a step at a time. All info will be shared in /r/2D3DAI and probably also in this subreddit.\n\nRegarding recording the event and putting it on youtube - It will definitely be recorded, if I see that the quality is good, I will also publish it online. Will update in the new subreddit (and via email to those who registered).\n\nLet's do this \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edited 4\\]\n\nSince there is more growing interest and people who might be interested in other talks, feel free to leave your info the the google form above ([https://forms.gle/wSXexXSBj5e5267G8](https://forms.gle/wSXexXSBj5e5267G8)) and I will send out an update via email when more free lectures in similar topics are scheduled.",

I really hope that you'll enjoy going through this notebook and gain not only technical skills but also analytical skills from it. We will discover how to process text in order to infer sentiment from it and try to take advantage of every result, visualization and failure in order to further understand the data and the models.\n\nThroughout this notebook, we will discover the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by building a sentiment analysis model. The goal of such a model would be to classify tweets as either having positive or negative sentiment. We will first build a Na\u00efve Bayes model, a classical statistical approach for sentiment classification, and then compare it to a Deep Learning model - LSTM.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your feedbacks!",

    "postText": "Why is ML software so horrible? Why the fuck does it take literally DAYS to configure a proper ML environment?\n\nI just spent 5 hours trying to install tensorflow with GPU support without success. \n\nI've tried just pip installing tensorflow-gpu. But that doesn't work because it blindly assumes I have exactly cuda 10.0 installed, but on my system it's already cuda 10.1. WHY ISN'T THAT COMPATIBLE??!?\n\nBut ok, sometimes things are a certain way and you just have to deal with it. So manually installing cuda 10.0 should fix it. So I download the cuda 10.0 package and try to pacman -U cuda-10.0.130-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz and BOOM, ERROR! Installing cuda 10.0 apparently needs gcc7, but I have gcc8 installed. Again: WHY ISN'T THAT COMPATIBLE??!?\n\nBefore I completely destroy my dev machine, I'll try another way to gpu support. On the [Tensorflow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source) it says the easiest way to get tf with gpu support is using the docker image. So I install docker... but no no no, not that easy. First I also have to install nvidia-docker, which i understand is a way to give docker apps gpu access. But no no no, there is ofc no package for my system, so I need to fetch it from the AUR. So I install pamac to install nvidia-docker, install nvidia-docker and THEN IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK. \"Unknown runtime specified nvidia.\"\n\nWell... then I'll just have to build TF from source manually. To avoid easy mistakes, I use this [very recent guide](https://mc.ai/build-tensorflow-2-0-from-source-with-gpu-and-tensorrt-supports-on-ubuntu-18-04/) on how to do that. It's for Ubuntu, but most things should be similar. Noo, that also requires an old gcc version. But ok, gotta try it anyways. Aaaaaand next problem. EVEN THOUGH I PROPERLY TOLD IT WHICH CUDA VERSION I HAVE INSTALLED AND WHERE IT IS, THE BUILD SCRIPT CANT FUCKING FIND IT: \"no such package '@local_config_cuda//cuda'\"\n\n    Cuda Configuration Error: None of the libraries match their SONAME: /opt/cuda/lib64/libcublas.so.10.1, /opt/cuda/lib/libcublas.so.10.1\n\nTHESE FILES ARE LITERALLY AT THESE EXACT LOCATIONS! What is the issue?\n\nWhy can't I AT LEAST get a proper error message that you can understand without being actively involved in TFs development? I just want to train some neural nets, not get a degree in cuda programming.\n\n\n\nI've tried a few other guides but none of them work. Countless other people report the same problems.\n\nWhy is it so extremely hard and time-consuming just to set up a development environment? Machine learning is complicated enough by itself. I bet a lot of new people just give up after the first few hours of tinkering, this is so unfortunate. \n\nI have absolutely no problem with doing so research, editing some config files, manually building some tools, but there is a point where ANY motivation I had is just lost, because no matter what I try, there is always some component that is broken. \n\n/rant\n\nMy specs:  \ni7-4770k  \nASRock Z78 Pro3  \nGTX 1050 Ti 4GB  \nManjaro (kde) with Linux 5.1.1\n\n\nEDIT:  \nGod praise the mighty *conda install*",

It explains well the most common ML models one by one, and allows you to understand how they work first instead of just showing you how to code them in sci-kit learn without any explanation.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, if you feel confused definitely check this book out, it will initially explain everything very simply but also goes in a lot of details when you read further on. And it also teaches you how to apply the things you read about in practice!\n\nThere is also no need to rewrite the code yourself as you can check out the notebooks online at [https://notebook.community/](https://notebook.community/). For example the links for the first 3 v2 chapters:\n\n[The Machine Learning landscape](https://notebook.community/ageron/handson-ml2/01_the_machine_learning_landscape)\n\n[End-to-end Machine Learning project](https://notebook.community/ageron/handson-ml2/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project)\n\n[Classification](https://notebook.community/ageron/handson-ml2/03_classification)\n\nAlternatively you can also checkout the authors [GitHub](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)",

    "postText": "Learn machine learning in Python by editing a spreadsheet Heyo, I'm Nate!\n\nIn quarantine, I've been trying to learn machine learning in Python. Since I'm a beginner, I spend most of my time furiously browsing Stack Overflow to find the right Python functions :)\n\nAt school, I learned to do data analysis in a spreadsheet. Because spreadsheets are so visual, they make data cleaning and manipulation parts of machine learning much easier. I wanted to find a way to have this ease in my Python projects.\n\nSo I built [Mito](https://trymito.io/?source=reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning)!\n\nMito is an editable spreadsheet in your Jupyter notebook. Pass in a Pandas data frame, make the edits you want, and Mito will automatically convert your edits into Python code.\n\nYou can clean, filter, find/replace, and use standard spreadsheet functions in Mito, giving you the visibility and ease of a spreadsheet with the power of Python.\n\nI built Mito as an extension to Jupyter Lab, which I'm sure many of y'all use for ML projects generally. At a high level, you can think of this as inserting a spreadsheet into your notebook, and then some backend Python is responsible for creating an a \"Python translation\" of the edits you make to the spreadsheet.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts about how this might be useful to your learning. I'll be in the comments with my co-creators u/aarondiamond-reivich and u/Jake_Stack808. You can see more info [here](https://trymito.io/?source=reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning)!",

    "postTitle": "Pure NumPy implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN)",
    "postText": "Pure NumPy implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) tl;dr up front -\n\nI wrote a pure NumPy implementation of the prototypical convolutional neural network classes (ConvLayer, PoolLayers, FlatLayer, and FCLayer, with subclasses for softmax and such), and some sample code to classify the MNIST database using any of several architectures.\n\nAlong the way, I found that the typical ConvLayer example was absurdly inefficient, so I provided an equivalent solution that uses NumPy more efficiently and achieves a 1,000-fold performance improvement.\n\nHere's [the GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy), including a readme and a FAQ about the project and the new \"Stride Groups\" technique.\n\n---\n\nDuring my machine learning studies, I spent some time completing Dr. Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Coursera sequence, which is generally excellent. The main example, \"Building a Convolutional Network Step By Step,\" provides a NumPy-based implementation of a convolutional layer and max / average pooling layers and is a great learning exercise. However, looking back on the code, I was disappointed to find that it has some problems.\n\n* The code is provided in a Jupyter notebook with a lot of intermediate exposition and unit tests. While it is a great learning exercise, it makes for a poor reference for the code of an actual CNN implementation.\n\n* The code isn't very readable. Global functions, variables passed around in a clumsy dictionary called \"cache\" with string names for variables, cached variables that are never used again... it's quite messy.\n\n* The example isn't complete. The ConvLayer function calculates dW/db, but doesn't update the weights. It doesn't have a flattening layer, or any fully-connected layers, or any loss function or training algorithm - all of those are provided in different exercises.\n\n* Worst of all, it doesn't have any kind of application to a real problem. The next exercise in the course involves applying machine learning to classify the [MNIST handwritten digits data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)... but it doesn't use the NumPy code at all. Instead, it makes a hard transition into TensorFlow. \"Now that you know how CNNs work, forget all of that under-the-hood stuff and just use this platform!\" (Worse, the TensorFlow code is all 1.x, so it won't even run in today's TF 2.x environments without a bunch of backwards-compatibility edits.)\n\nGiven all of that - I set aside some time to take the example code, clean it up, and add the bits that are missing. The results are nice: every basic layer type as a Python class and a Network class to train them.\n\n[https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/cnn_numpy.py](https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/blob/master/cnn_numpy.py)\n\nThen I wrote some code to use it to classify the MNIST handwritten digits data set:\n\n[https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/mnist.py](https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/blob/master/mnist.py)\n\nThe problem was that the CNN class is so slow that it's unusable!\n\nBoth the ConvLayer and PoolLayer classes feature a four-layer-deep iteration for both forward propagation and backpropagation:\n\n    for i in range(number_of_samples):\n        for h in range(output_height):\n            for w in range(output_width):\n                for f in range(number_of_filters):\n                    # do some stuff\n\nLet's say you want to apply a simple CNN to the MNIST database, which has 70,000 images. You choose a 95%/5% train/test split, so the training set has 65,500 inputs. Each image is 28x28x1. Let's say you want to apply one convolutional layer with 32 filters of size 3x3, stride 1, padding 0. (A 3x3 filter of stride 1 is shifted 26x26 steps over each image.)\n\nBased on those hyperparameters, this iteration requires 65,500 * 26 * 26 * 32 = 14,168,960,000 iterations of this loop. That's 14 *trillion* iterations for forward propagation over one training epoch. Backpropagation requires another 14 trillion iterations. Altogether, it requires about 36 hours *for one epoch* on a decently powered workstation (no GPU, because NumPy).\n\nNow, NumPy is really fast - if you use it right. But no matter how optimized it may be, 28 trillion calculations is going to take forever.\n\nSo I redesigned it to minimize iteration, and instead came up with a new computational technique that focuses on array slices to align the parts of the input tensor with the corresponding parts of the filter tensor.\n\nThe new implementation is 100% equivalent to the prototypical example - you can drop it right into place. And it runs *1,000 times faster*. You can actually train this updated CNN on the MNIST database to under 5% error in about five minutes. It's certainly nowhere near as efficient as TensorFlow or PyTorch, but it works reasonably well for simple problems like the MNIST data set.\n\n[https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/cnn_numpy_sg.py](https://www.github.com/neuron-whisperer/cnn-numpy/blob/master/cnn_numpy_sg.py)\n\nI've provided a complete write-up of the original technique, my extension into a full implementation, and my optimization. A FAQ is provided for more information.\n\nI hope that other students of deep learning find this useful or interesting. Comments welcome.",

I think we have enough of them.\n\nThere are so many of the same shallow posts trying to explain all of machine learning in one stupid infographic and somehow they always end up getting a ton of likes.I don\u2019t see how they are actually helpful to anyone though.If you actually want to help the community and want to make (or more likely steal) a little info graphic, post something that focuses on depth of a single topic rather than trying to overreach.   It would be much more helpful to the community.A single post explaining just Dropout OR just L2, would be much more helpful and insightful than a post that tries to explain every single concept related to overfitting.\n\nUnfortunately this will likely not change though if we as a community continue to upvote these crappy little \u201cguides\u201d that teach you all of machine learning...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I would like to mention that I don't think all infographics are inherently bad.

Let me know what you guys think about these:\n\n* [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) \\- An ML platform by Google Cloud. They have AI-powered tools to ingest, analyze, and store video data. Good for image classification, NLP, recommendation systems etc.\n* [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/) \\-They offer a neural search solution that can help build smarter, more efficient search engines. They also have a list of [cool github repos](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) that you can check out. Similar to Vertex AI, they have image classification tools, NLPs, fine tuners etc.\n* [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) \\- an open-source platform for managing your ML lifecycle. What\u2019s great is that they also support popular Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and R.\n* Neptune.ai, which promises to streamline your workflows and make collaboration a breeze.\n\nHave you guys tried any of these platforms?

[https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions)\n\nI'm looking at this project which won't take too long to run as the sample size is pretty small (<100k) but there are other researchers with sample sizes of 1m+ samples and I don't see those researchers uploading the final weights either. What is the point of doing this? I know the final weights will differ depending on the random state chosen, but there's a lot of people where it's really inconvenient to run a complex neural network on a million samples and they just want to try out the estimator in other contexts to see if it works well or not. Why upload everything but the main thing some people are interested in? Am I missing something?",

    "postText": "Python-based Educational Tools for Machine Learning Hi all,\n\nI teach a high school outreach course in ML through MIT and have been developing some free educational tools / resources towards this end over the past few years. Hopefully these will be helpful for students / teachers alike:\n\n[mygrad](https://mygrad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) is a auto-differentiation library that is a thin wrapper around NumPy. With mygrad in hand, my students need only learn NumPy's syntax and rules for array mathematics, but still have the power of auto-diff available to them. It also provides essential operations (e.g. N-dimensional convolutions, pooling, batch-norm, a numba-compiled GRU, etc.) for creating neural networks. This library is simple but quite powerful, if I do say so myself!\n\n[noggin](https://noggin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a library for live-logging and live-plotting measurements during experiments, all in a Jupyter notebook. Think of this as extremely simple version of TensorBoard. This is a great tool for my students to monitor their models' progress in real time. The logging is quite nice too and exports measurements as xarrays (I also use this tool in my actual research!)\n\n[Python Like You Mean It](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/) is a totally-free (no ads!) resource for learning the basics of Python and NumPy, with a bent towards STEM applications. This has proven to be an effective resource for students to develop the sort of Python experience that they need in order to be effective in ML.\n\nI hope that you all find these resources useful. Please also pass these along to educators who may be well-served by them! :)",

    "postText": "How do you guys maintain motivation on learning ML? As the title suggests, how do you guys keep pushing yourselves on learning ML? I actually self-taught myself web development, made a freelance gig and was successful. So I tried on self-learning ML and said to myself I was successful in self-learning web development, so why not ML.\n\nI am currently enrolled on **Free** Udemy ML courses or skimming through books and I feel overwhelmed by the different math concepts and literatures. Fortunately, I did an engineering degree and was exposed to the math concepts like linear programming, vectors, matrix, and etc. so I'm actually not starting from scratch.\n\nI was actually excited when I planned on learning ML but these days I'm finding it hard to push myself on watching and logging in on the internet to learn. I feel like I'm in a bit of a stump and I am afraid that I might just quit on trying haha. I feel like the reason is in terms of gratification, like I'm not seeing results of my learning immediately compared to when I was learning web dev. Like those little joys when I make something work on a web page and stuff like that haha. I just don't get it through the ML courses I am doing. Don't get me wrong I genuinely want to learn ML, I just don't know how to push myself and get motivated again.\n\nAnyway going back to the main question, did you guys experience any of this? If yes, how would you suggest on getting through it? I'm thinking on enrolling on a paid course or just get into a University instead so I am actually forced to learn haha.\n\nBy the way, the courses or videos I went through were mainly focused on discussing the Mathematical foundations of ML. Basically, it goes through all the basic operations that you'll do in ML.\n\n**Edit.** My end goal in this so far is to be able to be knowledgeable enough to implement models and etc. Just to get my foot in it, then maybe explore on research or application of existing researches. If it goes well, then maybe a back-up career if I grow out of my current job (Data Analyst).\n\n**Edit 2.** Sorry, fell asleep and woke up to this!! Wow, I appreciate all your responses. It's reassuring to know that this community is helpful for noobs like me haha. Thanks guys!! Based from what I saw on the comments, I think its just probably my approach on learning ML. I focused too much on the concepts and fundamentals and it got too dry on me fast haha. I'll try on the suggested sites, approaches, and books to maybe go around this stump. I'll still look around on the fundamentals but maybe not too much. Really thankful for all your responses. I'm planning to post up on my learning path in the future if I succeed in this, to someday help starters like me. Still feel free to add anything in the comments!",

    "postTitle": "Hidden Features in JupyterLab",
    "postText": "Hidden Features in JupyterLab If you work as a Data Scientist, you probably also spend the majority of your workday analyzing data in JupyterLab. So it is a good time investment to learn a few built-in JupyterLab features that will simplify your workflow.\n\n# 1. Workspaces\n\nJupyterLab\u2019s Workspaces comes in handy when working on multiple projects at the same time. Workspaces come builtin with JupyterLab so no third-party extensions are needed.\n\nWith Workspaces, you can separate your projects into Workspaces. Then you switch between a Workspace for project A and a Workspace for project B.\n\nBefore using Workspaces, I had to close all Notebooks from one project and open the Notebooks for the project I intended to work on. I prefer a clean work environment.\n\nUsing Workspaces is really simple. Unknowingly you were already using Workspaces. You start with a default Workspace: [http://localhost:8888/lab](http://localhost:8888/lab).\n\nTo create a new Workspace (or access the existing one) simply add to the URL: /[workspaces/blog](http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/blog). With this, you would access (or create) a blog Workspace. A full URL is [http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/blog](http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/blog).\n\n[Organize your projects in Workspaces.](https://i.redd.it/qdxjgn9gwz061.gif)\n\nWorkspaces have many powerful features, which are beyond the scope of this article. See [JupyterLab URLs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/urls.html#url-workspaces-ui) to learn more about Workspaces.\n\n# 2. Window Management\n\nDid you know that JupyterLab has a built-in window manager (no third party extension needed)?\n\nYou can organize Jupyter Notebooks side by side (or even three Notebooks vertically or horizontally). You can also move Jupyter Notebooks (or any window) to so that it takes less visual space\u200a\u2014\u200athis is useful for the Console.\n\n[Window management in JupyterLab.](https://i.redd.it/43oyifu4wz061.gif)\n\nTo code without distractions try Full-Screen editing with JupyterLab. It works great on macOS. When using it, it is hard to distinguish JupyterLab from a full-fledged IDE.\n\n[Full-Screen editing using Chrome on macOS.](https://i.redd.it/n2wn6aeawz061.gif)\n\nWhile Full-Screen editing in JupyterLab looks great, I rarely use it as it hides browser tabs, which makes browsing the web difficult. Multiple screen setup might help to overcome this issue.\n\n# 3. Use CLI in Jupyter\u00a0Notebook\n\nDid you know you can access Command Line Interface (CLI) directly from a Jupyter Notebook? You can run CLI commands with\u00a0! prefix.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a missing Python package. You can simply install it from Jupyter Notebook by running in the cell:\n\n    !pip install numpy\n\n[Using CLI in a Jupyter Notebook](https://i.redd.it/bqw28sllwz061.gif)\n\nSee [5 Hidden Features in JupyterLab You Should Start\u00a0Using](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-hidden-features-in-jupyterlab-you-should-start-using-bfd9402464ca?sk=178d2f6d83b1b80308d0e81deb1f0521) for more.",

There are a ton of packages out there that can get a lot of stuff done and given a package, there must be someone who is familiar with it. This group then collect info on what the community needs/wants to learn.\n\nThen, learning paths are created for several applications of machine learning. These should describe the best set of content (blog posts/videos/tutorials, etc) and suggest an order to complete them.\n\nThe next step would be to share this content and have a chatroom, preferably in discord. In discord, members have levels that can be improved by completing parts of learning paths or completing projects. These projects will be judged by the community through votes. Members who have a higher level will have more value on their votes and can have the right to suggest changes to the learning paths.\n\nAll this must be done free of cost.\n\nEdit: Wow, there are a lot of comments. I'm in the middle of some exams right now. I'll read them all and respond after Friday.",

    "postText": "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow - recommendation Hi,\n\nA few months ago I decided to start with ML (complete beginner), I searched online for free tutorials, but I couldn't really find anything good. I kept on feeling very confused and I barely understood linear regression. After a while I decided to buy the book called: 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. \n\nThis was literally the best thing I ever bought. I finished reading it yesterday and I feel like I understand a lot about ML (especially neural networks).\n\nI love how this explains the most common ML models one by one, and allows you to actually understand how they work (without confusing too much), instead of just showing how to code them in sci-kit learn without any explanation.\n\nThe author also has a github page with all the code used in the book, so there is no need to rewrite it.\n\nIf you are a beginner or you are feeling confused definitely check this book out, it will explain everything very simply but still in a lot of details. It also teaches you how to apply the things you read about in practice!\n\n*If you have any questions about the book feel free to ask me!*\n\nPS: THIS ISN'T SPONSORED!!!",

I'm excited to share my latest article about a new open-source technology called OpenChatKit.\n\nFor those who work in NLP, you're probably familiar with ChatGPT - a powerful language model that can perform various natural language processing tasks. However, ChatGPT is not open-source, which limits its accessibility and customizability.\n\nOpenChatKit, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT that provides users with similar NLP capabilities while allowing for more customization and control. With OpenChatKit, users can train their own models and fine-tune them to their specific use cases.\n\nIn my article, I dive into the features of OpenChatKit, the Instruction-tuned Large Language Model, and the Limitations of the Model.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about OpenChatKit and how it can enhance your NLP workflows, check out my article [OpenChatKit: Open-Source ChatGPT Alternative ](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/03/openchatkit-opensource-chatgpt-alternative.html).

This is because when a model overfits it performs extremely well on the training data that it is provided but performs poorly and fails to generalize on unseen data.\n\n\ud83d\udcbe You can imagine overfitting with an analogy. When one assumes that the questions in the exercise session of a lecture are exactly what will be asked in the exam and end up memorizing them. During the exam, they realize that this rote-learning would not be of any help in answering unseen questions.\n\n\ud83d\ude2e Overfitting can be avoided in many ways. 5 common ways to do so is by (1) regularization of the model parameters using L1 or L2 norm for example (see previous posts for more details), (2) gathering more training data to let the model cut through the noise, (3) early stopping by monitoring the training and validation error curves, (4) reducing the number of features by selecting better features and (5) by performing data augmentation.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the first post and hopefully the first of many to come.

I will bring up different topics of ML in the form of short notes which can be of interest to existing practitioners and fresh enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe posts will cover topics like statistics, linear algebra, probability, data representation, modeling, computer vision among other things. I want this to be an incremental journey, starting from the basics and building up to more complex ideas.\n\nIf you like such content and would like to steer the topics I cover, feel free to suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments.",

Hi Guys,\n\nAs the title says, I have just finished Andrew NG's deep learning speciailization, I feel quite proud of it, especially having finished his Machine Learning courses prior, in like 2 months total, However, most of the code I have written so far, is just snippets of code that'd I just write in Jupyter, I feel like this course really lacks some real hands-on project work, and this is the area where I want to focus on next, I have been told Kaggle is a great way to start but just when I was looking around in Coursera I found another Deep[Learning.ai](https://Learning.ai)'s specialiaztion aimed for Tensorflow Practice, would you recommend that over Kaggle to dive deep into TF first, I would love to hear your thoughts regarding this topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your time, and have a good day.",

I finished Andrew Ng , blue1brown linear alg/calculus courses, and hands on machine learning by Geron. \n\nRight now I'm doing practice projects for ml but I want to go more in depth and learn about what happens behind the state. Sure, i can keep on coding and go through books that teach me how to code better for ml but in the end, im just using existing functions and libraries to code. If I want to make something innovative with ml, it's pretty hard to do something innovative just by coding. Going through kaggle competition submissions helped me see that literally every submission in the top 50 had the exact same code. Learning how ml actually works is more important to me. So, what are some books or courses that go rigorously into the theory, math, and science behind machine learning? I don't have a super strong math background and I don't want to spend too much time getting stuck on learning the math so what are a few good shorter courses good for the math?\n\n\nIn short, what i want is a book that teaches stuff behind machine learning include deep learning rigorously so that by the end, i can end up creating my own algorithms just using my knowledge on theory. I want to spend more time working on developing new algorithms rather than creating my own code. What are some good books/courses for this? If advanced math is a prerequisite, what are some shorter courses to learn it? Something to help appreciate and truly understand the beauty and complexity of machine learning/deep learning",

I am a 21 year old college student in Canada who is very fascinated with the future of AI and machine learning. I will graduate this semester with a degree in Social Sciences with Math. How could I get a headstart on the trends which will be the future of this career? I am hearing many things on how Pytorch is an incredible library but people who started with Tenserflow are sticking to that, even though it is (allegedly) much more difficult and worse user interface. I have begun learning Python in my free time on [udemy.com](https://udemy.com), but I am only in the early stages. What can I do to thrive in this environment? \n\nI am fascinated by music, and I am very comfortable using Ableton Live 9, and quite advanced (been doing it for about 6 years now). There is a company who developed a program called Magenta, which can generate 2 bars of music based on something you give it as an input. For example, if I feed it Vivaldi's 8th symphony, it will generate a (freakishly coordinated and clean) output which sounds exactly like that last piece, but just different enough where it is a new composition entirely. I am also fascinated by VFX and compositing in softwares such as After Effects. I want to somehow mesh all of these together, but I don't know where to start. I feel like investing too much time in a way of coding that is not oriented around my future profession could be a waste of time, and amount to very little in the field I want to explore later in the future. Any and all tips are appreciated.\n\nCheers",

In my first 6 months there, I was required to make exactly one (1!) regression model. That was just us kids being nervous and having something to prove.) \n\nI remember bristling with frustration because I'd just learned all these crazy cool techniques in college and I was using precisely zero of them. I thought there was something wrong with the job or the company. \n\nNow that I've got some experience, I understand that this is what the typical data job looks like. There are months of boring chores you have to do before you can make that one model that's genuinely useful.

I am a new graduate spent most my time in college doing ML (still not very good at it but eventually I\u2019ll get there) I have been looking for some internships or entry level jobs in the field but i always come across some of these jobs wanting me to know front end/back end development. Is it norm? If so I better study some of that or are these companies just looking to squeeze more work out of someone for lesser pay",

    "postText": "Andrew Ng programming exercises kinda weird I'm doing Andrew's Machine Learning course on Coursera and I'm really demotivated when it comes to the programming parts. \n\nI'm good with the math and the coding. When it comes to writing a cost function on Octave, I just sit a while to translate the equation to code, and it's done. \n\nBut some exercises seem like a puzzle, just to understand what am I supposed to do. \n\nOn week 6, ex5 learningCurve for example. It's supposed to be a simple learning curve plot. But there's so many exceptions and \"oh you should do just one sample here and change lambda there because idk just be like that\". Not to mention times that the calculus I learned just didn't work in the code (Theta transpose X never worked, I had to write X times Theta) . I was trying to understand wtf I had to do for 40min until I just googled a solution. \n\nIt's the only thing that really holds me back from wanting to finish the course. Everything else is perfect. I want to know if there's somewhere I can better understand these exercises, like some ytb channel. And if I'm the only one that has this problem.",

I should mention that I was actually pretty familiar with keras before I took the course. After completing the course I realized that it is Insanely Easy to create Deep Learning Models using this Library. \n\nCreating a CNN with use of transfer learning is just a one liner. You can basically pick any architecture and set everything up in just a single line. You don't have to worry about over fitting your model, whereas in TF you have to basically set up each layer sequentially followed by dropouts and max pooling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there are other features like the lr\\_finder which comes in very handy to pick a learning rate. Since 4 days, I had been attempting to do a deep-learning challenge  with TF and managed to get accuracy of 70%. I used the FastAI lib and it shot straight to a 90%. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I still don't see people using this lib. Keras is still a standard go to. Surely there must be some downsides to it. As I am very new to machine learning I just want to know what are the trade-offs of using this lib ?",

People who will say \"I've been studying cs for 2 months and I don't get Turing machines yet\", or things like that.\n\nPeople, computer science is Hard! There are lots of people that claim you can learn enough in a 4 month crash course to get a job, and for some people that is true, but for most of us, getting anywhere in this field takes years.\n\nHow does [the internet, Linux, compilers, blockchain, neutral nets, design patterns, Turing machines, etc] work? These are complicated things made out of other complicated things made out of complicated things. Understanding them takes years of tedious study and understanding.\n\nThere's already so much imposter syndrome in this industry, and it's made worse when people minimize the challenges of this field. There's nothing worse than working with someone who thinks they know it all, because they're just bullshiting everyone, including themselves. \n\nSo please everyone, from an experienced dev with a masters degree in this subject. Heed this advice: take your time, don't rush it, learn the concepts deeply and properly. If learning something is giving you anxiety, lower your expectations and try again, you'll get there eventually. And of course, try to have fun.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards everyone.",

    "postText": "The advice I wish I would have recieved a few years ago When I was first starting my undergrad in CS, I came to this sub in utter frustration.  I had learned java, and was being asked to learn other languages, too. I struggled to adapt.  I knew the concepts, but I didn't know how to translate that into another language. I didn't even know how to start learning C or C++.  I came here asking for advice and reassurance, however I received anything but.\n\n\"If you can't learn another language, you shouldn't be in the field.\"\"You should switch majors now before you've gone too far, because you're going to be worthless in the field.\"\"What did you expect when you signed up for CS?  Of course you're going to have to learn another language. Get over yourself.\"\n\nThese comments on a long deleted post stuck with me.  The people who posted them have probably forgotten what they said.  They have no idea how hard it was for me to read those words, and how their words made me genuinely think that I wasn't cut out for this area of study.\n\nThey were wrong.  I'm now about to graduate, am in the top 10% of my class, and have overcome the struggle of adapting to new languages (mostly!).  I'm still far from being an expert, but I've come a long ways.\n\nI'm now here to give the advice my younger self was seeking, in the hopes that it'll help some of you who feel discouraged in the same way I was.\n\n1. Learning a new programming language gets easier over time.  Of course you're going to struggle when you learn your first or second language! That's fine! It's normal! It's a new concept for you! Don't give up!\n2. Focus on the big picture!  Learn about efficiency, data structures, and theories.  Explore data science and machine learning.  Don't be afraid to take a class just because you don't know the language that'll be used!  Computer science is more than learning the differences between python and java.  So much more.\n3. Just because you know a lot of languages doesn't necessarily mean anything.  It's more important to know the concepts and how to apply those concepts in your code.  You can always google for the specific implementation!\n4. Reading all the documentation about a language doesn't mean anything until you sit down and start coding.  I know it's anxiety inducing. I know it's tough to get to that point.  Start off learning how to print, how to make lists/arrays, and how to iterate.  Implement those concepts.  That'll give you a good idea of how to begin.  Your compiler or IDE may give you errors. That's fine!  You can learn from them.  Just start at the first error you get, and work your way through.\n5. Everyone struggles in the beginning.  You're not unusual for crying out of frustration.  You just need to take a deep breath and ask for help.  If you're struggling, you should seek out people willing to help you.  There's no shame in it.\n6. Don't listen to miserable people on the internet.  You are good enough.  You chose a hard field, but you got this.\n\nAnd my final bit of advice goes to the people on this sub:\n\nBe kind.  Your words have meaning, even if you comment in a hurry.  The person on the other end may genuinely be affected by what you say, so make sure they're affected positively.  \n\n\nedit: a word",

He also opens every document and application over the terminal instead of clicking on it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe honestly inspires me to actually take my assignments seriously.

    "postText": "As a CS person who hires both developers and CS kids, here is some advice (This is going to be enlightening to some and very brutal to others. I dont apologize for anything as this is reality.)\n\nEdit 2: will be away for a bit bit will return to answer questions later. TLDR: To me, CS is a beautiful art. The blend of CS and Math and other disciplines makes it imo one of the best skillset to have! I hate seeing the new javashit.js bloated pushed around so much and not enough promo is being made for CS. Keep CS beautiful!\n\nPLEASE DO YOUR MATH AND STATS! This is the best advice i can give anyone out there! I see many questions on here about how relevant is calculus and linear algebra in the workplace. Let me answer that with a simple statement: You can work for me or you can work with me.\n\nIve hired quite a few people that went to some school for Web Programming/Angular.js/blablabla framework bootcamp/shortcourse and yes ive hired them for the going rate of what a web developer but the problem is they remain right there, with no chance of moving up. Ive heard all the complaints about \"Not progressing, not going up, not being given enough opportunities to do more serious stuff...\" All they end up doing is converting excel spreadsheets into databases and make front end forms to fill the data.\n\nCS is definitely not programming - get that out of your head! At some point, every business/workplace has some challenges that need those special CS skills to solve. And people with CS are very hard to find usually only 2-3&#37; of the resumes i go through have proper CS in them.\n\nAt my previous job I was work in metal mining and I had hired a CS kid for his co-op term and he didnt even know half of the programming languages out there but he said he was OK with Python. What was really impressive was his background in computer vision, algorithms, linear algebra, calculus etc. We had to de-water a lake up north in the north west territories and we had to estimate the number of fish in that lake that would be afected to report back to the RCMP, the local government, fisheries etc.\n\nWe brought in \"experts\" and nobody seemed to offer a good solution. This kid and I were going to work together on this project. You can imagine the massive backlash from our web developers. They tore me a new asshole, they brought the fury of the god of war on me. But my superiors knew the reason i chose this kid over our existing developers - they did not have the skills needed for this task and we are not a college that can teach them these skills. We tried to explain to them that they need a different set of skills for different tasks, we've even offered them paid training on some topics to get them started however they declined because of the math prep work needed. Unfortunately you need that 4 years of college education for that and we as a company cannot do such a thing. So naturally the developers hated him, excluded him out of their inner circle, would crack jokes at how he didnt know MVC and made fun of him when he was using python.\n\nSo we developed an underwater camera system using a few cameras placed in some spots in the lake. Kid wrote an algorithm that could identify fish in the video frames and he used his statistical knowledge and gave us a good solution on how to estimate the population of fish in that lake. We then spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to catch each fish and tag them so they could be transferred to another lake. His estimate was about 94&#37; of the total fish we caught, a very impressive number! After that, all the other developers calmed their rage and they knew there was a clear distinction between them and this kid. This kid didnt know shit about MVC or angular or node and shit but he had what we really needed for us to get our environment permitting completed!\n\nWe worked on a few other interesting math-inspired projects until he got caught up by some oil company who was really impressed with the work he did for us and their office was close to where his parents lived so he relocated to the US.\n\nSo please, do your math! Ive been through calc and i hated it, but i pressed my nose and just went for it. I even went for the full specialist option in CS, it sucked balls, my life was spent in books and tears. I didnt really know what I was going to do in life and where I was going with all this math but I am so glad i did it even though i didnt get all A's in them lol. It does really pay off especially statistics which will open up a huge array of opportunities. Take up every opportunity you can: teachers office hours, TAs, workshops and anything you can. Math is not hard, youre just doing it wrong. People who are good in math are good at it because they figured out how to elarn math. Take the time and figure that out. My reason was simply i was overthingking math and that was making me panic often. Do it, because that math and stats skill will make you shine exponentially brighter during interviews! Ive known people at other companies offer a bonus cheque and RSU options if their CS candidate would take the offer.\n\n\\###Do not underestimate CS!\n\nCouple of other things i see on here and I can help answer:\n\n\\##Do grades and GPA matter?\n\nNo not really, unless we have doubts during the interview then we would want to see how you perform academically maybe youre just the type of person shy in interviews but when left alone you can do the job or at least be able to do the research needed to get the job done. However some companies put in a minimum GPA which i think is stupid as it shows they dont really know what they are hiring so they use the GPA system as an indicator when hiring people - watch out for these companies! Unless they are intern/co-op positions which will use GPA as method of filtering out thousands of applications.\n\n\\##What programming languages to learn?\n\nShouldnt matter. The programming language used varies from company to company and if you are real CS, you shouldnt worry about that because the monkey coding is usually offshored or sent to contractors/consulting companies. We want to hire you to solve our problems and usually that just requires paper and you can prorotype in python or anyting and nobody would care.\n\n\\##Unix or windows?\n\nAgain for a CS position we dont care. Leave that to the monkey coders to figure out\n\n\\##How much math do you use everyday?\n\nQuite a bit! I recently developed an algorithm that categorizes hazard and risk levels of contaminants (Arsenic, Asbestos, Beryllium etc) for underground workers in mines/excavation sites/drill rigs etc and it is almost purely based on statistics. That lower and upper confidence limits and the markov model do come in very handy!\n\n\\##Do you use proofs at work?\n\nThis is going to be probably one of the biggest points ive ever made. I hated proofs, i hated proving that fucking epsilon lies between whatever... I hated induction.. HOWEVER when i was first hired for my previous job as a CS kid, i had immediate and fierce reception from older self taught employees who have been \"programming\" for 10 years in their basements and were eyeing my position. I didnt understand until years later. Whenever i would create something, a simple algorithm for something, they would attack it and say they can do better or faster. This is where your proofs come in and you can also prove that their solution is faulty. This is where runtime algorithms and other proofing techniques (fucking induction) come in useful - you can PROVE that your solution works and if theirs is better, then they have to prove it using the same notation and technique - because this is what is required when you write published papers. The moment they see the Big-O notation is the moment they will scurry away and say \"sorry were too busy, go ahead with your project\"\n\nBecause that proof is your defence and your CS degree is the biggest supporter of your claim. That is the fastest way to make your boss feel safe in hiring you for the job. Your boss might not (and shouldnt necessarily) know shit about CS but with that proof document, they can use that to defend you and use that for auditing purposes etc.\n\n\\##Can i use university lectures from course era and other online resources?\n\nYes by all means do it. You can even get certifications for these online courses and they are definitely better than those angular bootcamps. If i asked you to explain the normal distribution and how it can be used, then we're talking!\n\n\\##Do i need the certifications from these online courses?\n\nYes. Let me explain why, if I were to give you a task that would affect the health and safety of people, environment etc, then you need to have that certification because if my ass gets audited one day, that cert will show that you are certified by an issuing authority (the college) that you know this field and you know what you are doing.\n\nAMA\n\nedit: typos",

    "postText": "/r/ComputerScience will be going dark starting June 12th in protest against Reddit's API changes which will kill 3rd party apps & tools ## Update (June 16th, 2023):\n\nThis subreddit remains closed to new submissions and comments as part of the ongoing protest over Reddit policy changes. However, we've chosen to switch the subreddit to read-only, so that existing user contributions will not be censored.\n\n# What's going on?\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader to Sync.\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.\n\nThis isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.\n\n# What's the plan?\n\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\nWhat can *you* do?\n\n1. **Complain.** Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n1. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord - but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail.\n\n1. **Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n1. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",

    "postText": "Research: Beating Google Recaptcha with 19 virtual machines for 10 hours straight &#x200B;\n\n[Captcha destroyer in action](https://i.redd.it/htxodrx0wj391.gif)\n\nI had this research project of developing my own captcha based on how you lose on this (deceptively easy) game. The idea is that a human would struggle to keep a finger in each dot since they move in random directions. It's INCREDIBLY hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lw1pizb4xj391.gif\n\nAnyhow I set to beat the state-of-the-art captcha of the time (2020) which was Google Recaptcha. I used 19 virtual machines as proxies and one all-powerful main VM running a VNC server(VNC is remote desktop). The logic is that you attempt only once per IP. When you switch an AWS instance on/off, you get a different IP every time, from a pool of around 1000 per region. The main machine turns the others on/off via AWS Cli commands, then makes an SSH tunnel to each, so that Firefox \"thinks\" it's running from one of the proxies. The image recognition is done with AWS Rekognition. Clicking is done with xdotool and screenshots taken with Maim. It has to run on the cloud because screenhots need to be uploaded to S3, then processed in less than 6 seconds. \n\nI made several videos, each 10 hours long, that show the system working on various websites, including Stack Overflow, Reddit, HackerNews and the Google Vision Api website(as a joke that Google didn't find very funny)\n\nHere are some videos of it working on different sites:\n\nGoogle Vision API(Google was angry at this one): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d\\_hnom0cLIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_hnom0cLIU)\n\nStackOverflow: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o8QHxy0ozo&t=2443s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o8QHxy0ozo&t=2443s)\n\nHackerNews: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_N16tjueYqg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N16tjueYqg)\n\nReddit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhPqZk8v6y4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhPqZk8v6y4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ALSO beat that captcha with the Animals AKA FunCaptcha(I think Linkedn uses it). As a comparison, Recaptcha took me like 2 months of hard work to beat, FunCaptcha took about a week and I had to use Google Vision API instead of AWS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Beating the FunCaptcha](https://i.redd.it/o5qvrvu8zj391.gif)\n\nHere's the video\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5nL5P9FIqg&feature=emb\\_title&ab\\_channel=PiratesofSiliconHills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5nL5P9FIqg&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=PiratesofSiliconHills)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCode:\n\n[https://bitbucket.org/Pirates-of-Silicon-Hills/voightkampff/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/Pirates-of-Silicon-Hills/voightkampff/src/master/)",

Sorry if this post doesn\u2019t quite fit this sub but this has been bothering me for ages and I\u2019ve recently hit a breaking point for my frustration. \n\nIt just pisses me off that there are 26 letters in the alphabet and 325 pairs of letters you can choose and for some reason the pair that we all seem to use is (i,j).  \nThere are literally no two letters that look more alike and that could get more easily mixed up but for some reason whether it be in code are in my case here in proofs and papers these two letters are always used together.  \nWhy should I have to use a magnifying glass to read a damn proof from a paper that couldn\u2019t have the decency to at least use a better font?\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop at (i,j). \nWe also love to use (m,n), (p,q), (u,v). \n\nLike I get it, it\u2019s more clear that the variables are related when they look alike, but it should certainly be more important that people don\u2019t mix them up???",

    "postText": "I love computer science. I hate my fellow computer science classmates. I need to get this off my chest, so please read my entire post instead of downvoting me based on my arrogant title. \n\nI am a computer science undergrad myself. I've always been fascinated with computers and the Internet ever since I was young. I simply cannot see myself working outside of this area - the incredible space for innovation and the power of exponential technologies is, to me, simply the most exciting thing I can think of. I constantly read about future technologies (shoutout to /r/Futurology) and find it disappointing that not many people share this admiration of mine, especially in this fantastic time period in which we live.\n\nI could spend hours talking about why I chose to study computer science, but I'll leave that for some other time. I need to talk about why I dislike my peers.\n\nI am definitely an introvert, but in my class of initially 50 people* I was probably the most outgoing. I haven't made many friends in college, which truly made me sad in the beginning because I could see myself making more (and better) friends if I were to study pretty much anything else. The only thing that me and 90% of my classmates have in common is that we, for different reasons, chose to study CS. Most of these people are your typical anime-loving gamers, which is of no interest to me. Most of them plan on focusing on game development, which is fine, but they simply don't have an open mind for other ideas an technologies. They play games and want to make games, as if that is even a realistic scenario. \n\nI don't even need to mention most of them are awkward as hell. This is no reason for me to dislike any of them, but it definitely makes it more difficult for me to bond with them. I have one good friend who shares common interests with me and doesn't act awkward at all. My other friends are nice people and (sometimes) good to hang out with, but they are definitely weird. I almost forgot to mention there is only one girl in my class, which really disappoints me, but I can't say I don't comprehend.\n\nI feel like we need more people in CS who are also interested in the arts and humanities, as I see this as an important trait for understanding the power of the technologies we deal with. As Steve Jobs said it, \"Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science, I like that intersection. There\u2019s something magical about that place.\"\n\nI think it is important to note that I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this is based on my point of view, I don't want to generalize CS students. I guess in a more developed country more people would be interested and open to the possibility of studying CS, and therefore providing more diversity among students. And that is exactly what I would like to see.\n\nI hope I haven't offended any readers in any way with my personal thoughts. I'm just very passionate about technology and can't seem to get the same vibe from the people I deal with on a daily basis.\n\n*I would say 50% of the people who started college with me already quit. Every semester some people leave, and we only had 2 (TWO) people graduating in CS last semester. But CS is hard, nothing new here.\n",

It's special in the sense that after applying the said transform it does not change direction but only gets scaled (multiplied by a scalar value) by the eigenvalue.\n\n\ud83d\udd28 Each eigenvector comes with a corresponding scalar called the eigenvalue. Breaking a matrix M into its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors is called eigendecomposition.\n\n\ud83d\udd2d The word \"Eigenvector\" comes from \"eigen\" in German where it means \"its own\". It was originally used to study rigid body motion and in the discovery of principal axes. However, nowadays it has found its way into a wide array of applications from my favorite: principal component analysis, differential equations, and problems in physics and chemistry relating to wave transport and molecular orbitals.\n\n\ud83c\udfad Another one of the classical applications is the Eigenfaces project for facial recognition. Eigenfaces decompose a face as a composition of face templates (basis) called eigenfaces. Imagine N eigenfaces E\\_1, ..., E\\_n when given a new face F it can be written as a composition of each of these N eigenfaces for example: F = (10% of E\\_1 + 55% of E\\_2 + 35% of E\\_3). Each eigenface would represent a meaningful feature in the high-dimensional space of faces.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have been studying and practicing Machine Learning and Computer Vision for 7+ years. As time has passed I have realized more and more the power of data-driven decision-making.

I will bring up different topics of ML in the form of short notes which can be of interest to existing practitioners and fresh enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe posts will cover topics like statistics, linear algebra, probability, data representation, modeling, computer vision among other things.

Here is our hackathon submission:\n\nhttps://devpost.com/software/naturallanguagerecommendations\n\n----\n\nAs a sidequest, we also build a TPU-based vector similarity search library. We are eventually going to be dealing with 9 figures of paper embeddings of size 512 or 256. TPUs have a ton of memory, and are very fast, so it might be helpful when dealing with a ton of vectors. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1LVlz34.png\n\nhttps://github.com/srihari-humbarwadi/tpu_index\n\n-----\n\nStuff we used: Keras / Tensorflow 2.0, TPUs, SciBert, HuggingFace, Semantic Scholar. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.",

    "postText": "I took my first step towards a degree in computer science today! Hello everyone I am fairly new to using Reddit. I showed interest in going to an online school for a degree in computer science. This morning at 10:00 DeVry University called me and talk to me for about 45 minutes before they offered me a chance to join their upcoming computer science program for a associates degree. I am 44 years old, I basically was the biggest a****** in high school and did not do any school work didn't do anything though somehow ended up graduating only by myself not with my class (Long story lol). Anyway I love building computers I love learning about computers I love everything about computers I've been doing masonry and construction work since I was out of high school. I cannot take it anymore. I have an 8-year-old daughter and I want to be able to do better for her so I figured this is my next step. I'm already at the end of the process for the FIFCA(something like that) student loan process. Right now I am unemployed and I figured it is the perfect time to start something like this. And then possibly move on and get my bachelor's. I live in a pretty big area in between New York and Philadelphia and thought about making my own computer repair business where I would travel to people's houses and fix any issues they have with them. And also I would build computers if people wanted a certain kind of computer I would build it for them. I've had many people ask me to already. I just really want to get into knowing the technical details and really learning about computers. I'm leaving my options open I'm just going for an associates In computer science with an open end I suppose from what I was told there are three different routes I could take after that to get a bachelor's degree. Just wondering if anyone had opinions? thoughts? I start and just over two weeks and I have never been excited for school in my life and now I cannot wait. And I'm at the age of that and there's no such thing as too much information. Thank you for your time reading this, hoping it was coherent enough for you to get an understanding where I want to go with my life and maybe some perspective from some people who are there or have been there.",

    "postTitle": "A Three-part Introduction to Algorithms for Computer Science Students and Self-taught Developers",
    "postText": "A Three-part Introduction to Algorithms for Computer Science Students and Self-taught Developers I just finished teaching my AP Computer Science students a series of lessons on algorithms, and I decided to write up a three-part intro series geared towards students and self-taught developers. I know how intimidating this topic can be, so I've been intentional about breaking it down and making it as accessible as possible. If you're new to the field or someone who needs a refresher, this is for you.\n\n# Part One: Expression\n\nCooking a delicious meal, baking a cake, and brewing the perfect cup of coffee all require one key ingredient: a recipe. In the field of computer science, that recipe is an algorithm. Like a recipe, it lays out step-by-step instructions for achieving a specific goal. You can write recipes in many different languages, and you can express algorithms in a variety of ways. Their primary methods of expression include flow charts, pseudocode, natural language, and programming language. Read on for a brief, memorable introduction to each one. \n\n>***algorithm*** *(n.) \u2014 a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.* \n\nImagine you are a busy executive with rules to determine whether you are available for a meeting. There are two parameters at the heart of your rule system: (1) the day of the week and (2) the distance. Given this information, can you generate an algorithm to filter potential meetings? Absolutely.\n\n[availability algorithm expressed as a flow chart](https://preview.redd.it/soaxpqturmga1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb4524a5299d34bd8267ffda49c6c96cf90f1b87)\n\nThis algorithm ultimately assigns a value of *true* or *false* to the Boolean variable \u201cavailable\u201d based on your rules. It can help you or your assistant make a decision quickly and easily. If the value of \u201cavailable\u201d is *true* at the end, you will accept the meeting. Otherwise, you will decline. \n\n**Flow charts** provide a visual representation of the algorithm\u2019s logic and flow. Creating them forces you to think carefully about sequencing and selection. *Which arrow goes to what node? Are there missing arrows?* These are invaluable questions that can arise when translating an algorithm into a flow chart, and answering them can lead you to identify potential errors.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to a similar algorithm expressed in **pseudocode**:\n\n[availability algorithm in pseudocode](https://preview.redd.it/l0tma0f1smga1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c7d29a3554ba24cd9ed5ba9139b4e372c699287)\n\nThis algorithm is slightly different, but it accomplishes the same objective by assigning a value of *true* or *false* to the Boolean variable \u201cavailable\u201d based on your rules. Despite its minor differences, it is just as effective as the algorithm depicted by the flow chart.\n\nPseudocode acts as a bridge between natural language and programming language. It allows you to express an algorithm in a way that most people can understand and lets you lay out the algorithm\u2019s logic and flow without worrying about the specific syntax of a programming language \u2014 which makes it easier to test and debug an algorithm before implementing it.\n\nCan we also express this date-availability algorithm in **natural language**? Of course.\n\n1. Create a Boolean variable \u201cavailable\u201d and set it to false.\n2. Check if the day of the week is a weekday. If it is not, end the algorithm.\n3. Check if the distance is greater than or equal to 20 miles. If it is, end the algorithm.\n4. If steps 2 and 3 are passed, set the Boolean variable \u201cavailable\u201d to true.\n5. End the algorithm.\n\nUsing natural language to express an algorithm makes it relatively easy for people to understand. This advantage is significant because it makes the algorithm easier to share with others, regardless of their technical background.\n\nHow about **programming language**? Definitely.\n\n[availability algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/iqwjmssasmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=df5810616c1551688d1b89ba4088a73473fe9f85)\n\nExpressing algorithms in a programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Rust, etc.) allows a computer to execute them directly. There is no need for any interpretation or translation. It also lets you take advantage of the tools and constructs provided by your favorite language. Another advantage is that it allows for automation and performance optimization, which is particularly useful if the algorithm has to be executed frequently or on large data sets.\n\n# Part Two: Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration\n\nYou\u2019ve learned the basics of algorithms and their modes of expression, but have you ever wondered how they make decisions and control the flow of a program? The answer is **sequencing**, **selection**, and **iteration**. In part two, we\u2019ll delve into how these fundamental concepts shape the functionality of algorithms, making them adaptable, efficient, and powerful tools for solving problems. \n\n**Sequencing** refers to the order in which you execute instructions. An algorithm is a step-by-step process, and it must take each one in the proper order to achieve its goal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejylwfa2tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8e88afa8f4ecfa6232e1b8d2909a0843fb18e0\n\n**Selection** refers to the ability to make decisions based on certain conditions. An algorithm may need to choose between different options based on a given input.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1ced5j4tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f8535992ab79d5e81630b2a7160b6e9ba817178\n\n**Iteration** refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions. It is a part of many algorithms, especially those that involve processing large amounts of data or repeating a task until a condition is met.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9hlp2p6tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e524ddd7da20fe0e2b8c109ca51d118f35772aa\n\n**An Example of Sequencing**\n\nThis algorithm designed to calculate the area of a rectangle offers a clear example of **sequencing**.\n\n[calculating the area of a rectangle in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yxowixhmtmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=742c7a7e11d5686f1388e5264e9f025800e49f75)\n\nNote the importance of order (a.k.a., \u201csequence\u201d) in this algorithm. First, it assigns a value of 3 to the variable *width* and 11 to the variable *height*. Next, it calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying *width* and *height*. Finally, it prints the result to the console. If you re-arranged these steps, you could stop this algorithm from producing the expected result.\n\nSequencing is vital because algorithms must execute their steps in the proper order. Otherwise, they will not work correctly. Remember, computers can only do what they are programmed to do. So if you program a set of steps in the wrong sequence, a computer will execute them in that sequence \u2014 even if the results are disastrous.\n\n**An Example of Selection**\n\nAn if-else statement to determine whether a number is positive or negative is an example of **selection**.\n\n[a simple selection algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yrcuncfutmga1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f361b3d72738e1903bc14d87f1d9f62e43a2d)\n\nIn this example, the algorithm uses an if-else statement to make a decision based on the value of the variable, *number*. If it is greater than or equal to zero, the algorithm executes the first block of code and prints \u201cthe number is positive\u201d to the console. If it is less than zero, the algorithm executes the second block of code and prints \u201cthe number is negative\u201d to the console.\n\nSelection is important because it allows the algorithm to make decisions based on conditions, which makes it more flexible and able to handle a wide range of problems, exceptions, and errors.\n\n**An Example of Iteration**\n\nThis algorithm designed to print the numbers 1\u201310 to the console is a perfect example of **iteration**.\n\n[printing a sequence of numbers in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/gjzhz4j0umga1.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf9f526632f1bd391d279f558b5a8a050e6d119a)\n\nIn this example, a for-loop repeatedly executes a command that prints the value of the variable *i* to the console. Before it does, it checks a condition \\[\\[ ***i*** **<= 10** \\]\\], and then executes its one command if and only if that condition evaluates to true. As soon as it evaluates to false, the loop will exit, and this simple program will finish running.\n\nIteration matters. It matters because it allows an algorithm to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, which is helpful if you are processing large amounts of data, repeating a task, or generating a sequence of numbers.\n\n# Part Three: Efficiency && Big-O Time Complexity\n\nNow that you\u2019re familiar with sequencing, selection, and iteration, it\u2019s time to take your understanding of algorithms to the next level by exploring the idea that **not all algorithms are created equal**. Some complete their task in a matter of microseconds, while others seem to drag on forever. In part three, you\u2019ll learn about Big-O notation and the difference between reasonable and unreasonable runtime. You\u2019ll also take your first steps towards assessing relative efficiency with an example: linear search versus binary search. This knowledge will lead you to write more efficient algorithms that will set you apart as a developer.\n\n>***Big-O Notation*** *(n.) a formal expression of an algorithm\u2019s complexity in relation to the growth of the input size. It is used to rank algorithms based on their performance with large inputs.*\n\n**Reasonable vs. Unreasonable Runtime**\n\nRuntime is the execution time of an algorithm. In other words, the amount of time it takes to complete its intended task. We can break it into two distinct performance classes.\n\n1. **Reasonable** (a.k.a., \u201cpolynomial\u201d) time describes **any runtime that does not increase faster than n\\^k**. Examples include: constant time (*n\\^0*), logarithmic time (log n), linear time (n), and quadratic time (n\\^2)\n2. **Unreasonable** (a.k.a., \u201csuperpolynomial\u201d) time describes **any runtime that increases faster than n\\^k**. Examples include: exponential time (2\\^n) and factorial time (n!)\n\nThe ability to scale effectively with the size of a given input determines this distinction between *reasonable* and *unreasonable*. Algorithms with *reasonable* runtime have predictable, limited growth in execution time as input size increases. On the other hand, algorithms with *unreasonable* runtime have exponential or even faster growth in execution time as input size increases. It\u2019s crucial to understand the complexities of the algorithm(s) that you\u2019re working with and to strive for reasonable runtime whenever possible so that your programs perform well and scale effectively.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a closer look at how some of the most common Big-O runtimes compare in terms of their scaling behavior.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jetr6bvjumga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a895cf5a7b2bede0b101412762a6df234347ce\n\nThis chart goes beyond *reasonable* and *unreasonable*. It analyzes seven different runtimes and rates them from \u201chorrible\u201d to \u201cexcellent\u201d. Note that quadratic time \u2014 **O(n\u00b2)** \u2014 is \u201chorrible\u201d despite its *reasonable* status in traditional computer science circles. This example indicates that there are levels to time complexity analysis and that even if your algorithm is *reasonable*, there may still be room for improvement and optimization.\n\n**Linear vs. Binary Search**\n\n[a linear search algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/y85mgvmpumga1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed36f259145f59480f575153ceea175336b984be)\n\nLinear search algorithms run in linear Big-O time: **O(n)**. Their execution time is directly proportional to the size of the data set they\u2019re searching.\n\nImagine you have a list of 100 numbers and a linear search algorithm to help you find the one you want. Unfortunately, it\u2019s at the end of the list. So if it takes one millisecond for your algorithm to evaluate a number and determine whether it\u2019s the one you want, you will have to wait 100ms. If you think about it, 100ms is only 1/10 of a second. So your algorithm is fast. Right? Wrong.\n\nReplace your 100-number data set with 1,000,000 numbers. Now how long will you have to wait? Worst-case 1,000,000ms, which is more than 16 minutes. Now we have a problem. The good news is that we also have a solution in binary search.\n\n[a binary search algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yb5stpzuumga1.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=decfc6fa9a8b63783486465b52c547e5317cfbed)\n\nBinary search algorithms run in logarithmic Big-O time: **O(log n)**, which is exceptionally fast. The catch is that they only work on sorted lists. If you read the code carefully, you\u2019ll see that they work by establishing (*and recursively updating*) a low-index and a high-index in a given array. They find the element halfway between those indices and check to see if it matches the target. If it does, they return the index position of the target. Otherwise, they update the appropriate index and repeat the process.\n\nThis method is remarkably similar to searching for the word *iteration* in a physical dictionary with 960 pages. You would first open it to one of the middle pages and evaluate the words. If they follow *iteration* alphabetically (i.e., they all start with the letter \u201cm\u201d), you know that your target word is in the first half of the dictionary. So, instead of searching through 960 pages, you are only dealing with 480. Remarkable! Now, repeat this process until you find the word *iteration*. This method is a brilliant example of logarithmic time complexity because the amount of time it takes to find the word increases logarithmically with the number of pages in your dictionary.\n\n[ This graph depicts the worst-case execution time of linear and binary search algorithms, assuming \\(arbitrarily\\) that it takes 1ms to evaluate each element.](https://preview.redd.it/54tgt660vmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=68dc7ca52d8aad27cc784285ead43786f9b2b241)\n\nIf you look closely at the graph, it\u2019s clear that the binary search algorithm is significantly more efficient \u2014 even when dealing with a data set that only contains 100 elements. But what if we were dealing with a data set of 1,000,000 elements? Remember that (worst-case) a linear algorithm takes \\~16 minutes to find its target. On the other hand, a binary search algorithm will only take 19.93 milliseconds. That\u2019s an extraordinary difference! Let\u2019s run one final scenario with 1,000,000,000 (one billion) elements. Working with this massive data set, a linear search algorithm would take more than 11 days to find its target, but a binary search algorithm would only take \\~29.90 milliseconds. Unbelievable. This extreme disparity is why it\u2019s so important to write efficient algorithms.\n\n[ This chart depicts the worst-case execution time of linear and binary search algorithms, assuming \\(arbitrarily\\) that it takes 1ms to evaluate each element.](https://preview.redd.it/e5e26ls6vmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=da160632ea0e59582ea89fd38a4155c55c1925a1)",

Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even\n\nthen don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#Rule 3.\n\n\\*Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is\n\nusually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know\n\nthat n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n\n\ndoes get big, use Rule 2 first.)\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#Rule 4.\n\n\\*Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and\n\nthey're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as\n\nwell as simple data structures.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#Rule 5.\n\n\\*Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data\n\nstructures and organized things well, the algorithms will\n\nalmost always be self-evident. Data structures, not\n\nalgorithms, are central to programming.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim\n\n\"Premature optimization is the root of all evil.\" Ken\n\nThompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as \"When in doubt,\n\nuse brute force.\". Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the\n\ndesign philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by\n\nFred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. Rule 5 is often\n\nshortened to \"write stupid code that uses smart objects\".\\*",

There's no way i'm going to give up because i know for sure this is what i want to do, but i just get frustrated with the difficulty of the advanced math sometimes because i know i will probably never use most of it in the course of a job as a developer/programmer. Yes i understand it's good for learning to problem solve and yes i understand that I may end up programming things like video games/ robotics that DO need some advanced mathematics. I am just not happy with how esoteric it all feels because I can't see how any of the mathematics is applied to the real world. It's like learning things in a vaccum. That's why i did great in physics in high school but struggle with calculus now. I need practical examples of problem solving to really solidify my knowledge of something.

I guess I need a little inspiration and actual input to those who have made it. Also if anybody has any advice on how I could learn pre calculus and calculus on a college level by my self since the teaching style my professor has doesn\u2019t match with my learning style, that\u2019ll also be appreciated.\n\nThanks for the advice and time.\n\nEdit: I know people probably won\u2019t look back at this but for the few people that helped me so much I wanna thank you guys so much; honestly I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve gotten through pre calc without your guys info, help, and guidance and what to do and handle this hurdle.

    "postText": "As Moore's law breaks down, will there be a resurgence in low level languages in the not too distant future? I believe the emphasis on vms, interpreters and containers and the like will be replaced when we need more efficiency.\n\nThese things are likely a luxury of the era that we live in\n\n\nAlso, this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox\n\n> In economics, the Jevons paradox (/\u02c8d\u0292\u025bv\u0259nz/; sometimes Jevons effect) occurs when technological progress or government policy increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use increases its demand, negating the efficiency gains.[1] The Jevons' effect is perhaps the most widely known pitfall in environmental economics.[2] However, governments and environmentalists[needs update] generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the effect arising.[3]\n\nIn addition to my original point, I think the current state of technology is allowing deeply inefficient code to ship. I wonder if the inefficiency is encouraged by use of certain technologies and frameworks and if they are \"long for this world?\"\n\nI'm curious as to what your thoughts are about this and how this would play out over time. Personally I can see low level languages becoming popular again but with heavy abstractions over it, something like a gui app that makes programming very easy but all the real, highly optimized work is done by an expert system (or an 'AI' if you wanna call it that)",

    "postText": "Code is magic I just had a wonderful realization and I thought I might share. To preface this, I always wanted to go to Hogwarts as a kid and learn magic. I became somewhat disenfranchised with the world as I grew older, but I have recently begun to rekindle a sense of wonder and excitement for the world.\n\nA big part of that has been learning to code. I was thinking about this the other day, and I realized that I have essentially been learning magic by any standard throughout history, and for some reason I take that for granted!\n\nThrough a high-level language, we manipulate electrons in order to create symbolic information patterns that can accomplish real tasks - to anyone from any other time in history, if they could see us they would think we were literally witches and wizards.\n\nAt Hogwarts the students learn to predict the rough future through magic. I can do the same with data analysis, game theory, and machine learning networks. They can see things from the other side of the world - I just finished coding a security cam for my dorm. They can imbue non-living matter with sentience - robotics. They can manipulate life - bioinformatics - if I had access to the right tools I could literally breed glowing animals. Artificial intelligence adds an even cooler aspect to this given we might soon be able to create sentience from non-sentient matter! Even the bad powers, killing people, controlling people etc are real - consumer programming, psychometric targeting through the internet, drone strikes, malicious hacking, etc.\n\nBy extension, everything we are exploring in modern science is really magic. We don't really know how this stuff works or why it works - if you look at the physical constants of the universe they seem somewhat arbitrary. While we do have a good sense of the relational properties between things in reality, we don't know why they are what they are - like electrons! We know the rules that dictate their interaction with other things in reality, but we don't know why they exist the way they do, where they came from, or for that matter where any of this really came from! Somehow through all these layers of abstraction, from basic properties of atoms and forces, to high-level symbolic computation, we manage to actually do stuff, and that stuff is no less absolutely amazing! I don't think it's hyperbole to say that we're all doing real magic.",

What would you guys suggest I do at this point of time to learn mathematics and progress to math for computer science?",

    "postText": "Programming is not what I thought it was when I was starting to learn it. I have been programming in various languages, environments, technologies for many years.\n\nGetting into programming was very exciting, you get to do all this cool stuff, talk to the machine, create worlds, fix problems, automate things. It was this comfortable environment where you talk to the machine and it just does what you tell it to do.\n\nBut, I didn't realize how flawed everything is. The deeper you go the more you realize how everything is holding on a tiny string, tied by duck-tape, ready to collapse any moment.\n\nThe flaws in each language, library, technology, environment. What is better, C++ or C#? Unity or Unreal? Custom engine? In which language? Which libraries? All custom code? Which platforms? Ruby or python? javascript or php? or typescript? or wasm?\n\nJust when making a choice on the stack to use, it is like a huge tree branching out indefinitely with issues and compromises.\n\nThe more optimistic programmers will say, just choose the right tool for the job! Every things has its place. But it is not that simple. What if you will need something different in the future? Do you rewrite all the code? Or do you just accept that you can't have it?\n\nIn my experiments and the search for universal language/environment to do different things, I have realized that it does not really exists. But the further realization is to why it doesn't exist. And that is due to how all the technology that exists is tied together. Different ideological reasonings and believes to what is right, sometimes cult-lite following of language of a technology, is all that I did not realize WHY it matters and WHAT are the consequences of it all.\n\nA bit of a ramble, I love programming, but my little utopia has been damaged. Didn't realize what I will have to deal with and no one really talks to you or prepares you for it. You only hear \"this is the right way\" again and again from people with opposite views, thinking that there is the right way somewhere, you just have to find it. But there isn't.\n\nI have just stumbled upon this, and it is what inspired me to write this post. Because with everything I already knew, I still didn't know it goes THAT deep:[https://gankra.github.io/blah/c-isnt-a-language/](https://gankra.github.io/blah/c-isnt-a-language/)",

ELI5 = Explain Like I am 5 (years old). Sorry if I am asking this question in the wrong sub, but this sub felt like the one best poised to answer it.\n\nThis question is about private repos only, not public ones.\n\nMy background: I know basics of programming, but have never worked with other programmers to use GitHub or any other kind of version control with multiple people. You can say that I am a casual programmer.\n\nSuppose Microsoft wants to acquire company A, who host their codebase in GitHub. What is preventing them from looking at the codebase of company A? If the acquisition target refuses to be acquired, can Microsoft simply look at the backend code of the company, copy crucial portions of it and slap a similar UI to it while adding a few more features? If they do so, will it ever be possible to verify for company A to even be aware that their codebase has been peeked at or more? Or is it technically impossible for Microsoft to look at it (due to encryption, etc)? \n\nMy question is generic. As in, I am not just talking specifically about GitHub, but online Git websites including Gitbucket, SourceForge, Bitbucket, etc.\n\nAlso on a related topic, how do companies like Apple, Google and others use version control? Can their employees look at the entire codebase, to be able to find inefficiencies and improve it when they can? If so, what is preventing a rogue employee from stealing it all? Or it is compartmentalized with limited visibility to only the people working on it? I would love to understand what tools they use and how they do it. If it is a lot, then links to articles/videos would be appreciated a lot.\n\nEDIT: I meant private repos only, not public ones.",

To be more specific, the tool in this case does not reference a language but rather built-in methods, third-party libraries, or modules.\n\nI try to do some research and extensive Googling before I start a writing a program but I find nothing relevant. However, an accidentally misclick or a random tutorial video shows me some miracle module that I missed that would've made my code (and my life) so much easier, but I'm already too deep in the program to do anything without completely changing the algorithm. It can be pretty frustrating.\n\nFor example, I wrote a bunch of complicated classes to try to store values for a statistics program, turns out there was a library called derby that I could've used instead. A script I created with a complicated algorithm to extract numerical data from files using certain keywords became obselete because I forgot regex existed. Hell, I just learned what ternary operators and it's made my life so much easier for the current script I'm writing now.\n\nHow do other programmers find what they need? I am I missing something? Or do I just need to suck it up and read through the official documentation and/or module indexes?\n\n**Edit:** Wow, this post blew up. I appreciate all of the responses.

The truth is, during spring break I researched this project in order to prepare and know what to expect, and I did end up finding the code that my professor is talking about. At the time, I thought it would be a helpful example of the questions I might be asked to answer later on. When the final project was released, I started working on it and only used the resources provided by the course (virtual office hours, piazza, etc), and didn\u2019t think much of it. But I now realize that the code I had seen earlier on had influenced me to an unacceptable degree, as the design approaches are similar and some parts are nearly identical.\n\nI feel that I did not have the intention of cheating and the shift of the class to online led me to make misjudgements in using online resources. I looked back at my professor\u2019s syllabus and it states that plagiarizing code has caused students to have to withdraw from the college in previous years. I\u2019m terrified about this, and am devastated that my professor might fail me (at my college, a failing grade cannot be made up) and that this will be on my record in some way.\n\nI\u2019m meeting with my professor this week to talk to him about it.

I was trying to print the contents of a map and I couldn't use what I thought was enhanced for loop like in Java. When I looked up solutions I saw that they were all for newer versions of c++ so I made a post inquiring about printing map contents in c++ 98.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Issue**\n\nLong story, within 5 minutes I had a couple of helpful comments assuming the answer was in the post that I liked in my question, however, I also had 4 downvotes.

Then save the screen from the safari page(print to pdf) and then upload those to another program. The thing is its the same repetitive process, so its extremely irritating doing it all day long.

Ok, so I understand that storing passwords in plaintext is bad, and encrypting passwords just means that now we have to keep a secret safe, and that isn't ideal either.\n\nSo the answer is to hash password values to some fixed-length value using a hashing algorithm. \n\nA frequently cited problem with just hashing a password is that a hacker could use common passwords and employ the same hashing algorithm and essentially dictionary attack a resource. \n\nBut something I don't understand is this: if hashing algorithms are deterministic, that is, given the same input they always produce the same output, and the algorithms themselves are known, then couldn't a hacker essentially reverse the steps taken to hash values and produce the original input? Why is the rainbow attack method even necessary?\n\nThat's my first question.\n\nI also know that salting hashes introduces randomness into the hashed values. I get how this means that an attacker can't carry out a rainbow attack using common hashes to guess passwords - but then how the heck is the password later verified? If I've randomized the hashed password, how can I check it against credentials I get from the user which will also be salted randomly and hashed?",

If someone wants to know how computer science is going to change healthcare they can read a buzzfeed article. If they want to discuss how a specific algorithm with a specific use case, we can have a conversation. Perhaps a rule along the lines of \"Posts must be directed and demonstrate research and reasoning. Vague or general posts are not allowed\". Then we can at least report the came-to-r/computerscience-after-reading-two-buzzfeed-articles-and-a-towardsdatascience-blog crowd.\n\nFive days ago the mods updated the rules to exclude job advice, and this is a good step in the right direction for reviving the conversations in this subreddit, but I think we need to go further to make this a place where actual computer scientists want to spend their time.\n\n\nDo others agree?",

I didn't realize this until now when I searched up the word \"synchronous\" on Merriam Webster, but the definition of the word in English is:\n> happening, existing, or arising at precisely the same time\n\nHowever, in the context of programming, synchronous programming usually mean that instruction are executed one at a time(so not happening at the same time). \n\nConversely, the word \"asynchronous\" in English, according to Merriam Webster, means:\n>  not simultaneous or concurrent in time \n\nAgain, in the context of programming, asynchronous usually means that instructions are executed in parallel, which is the opposite of what the word means in English.. \n\nMy burning question is, why is this the case? I'm I just bad at English or do you guys find this weird too?

I have been working in IT for half a year now and understand general computer hardware but understand little of the low level OS side of things. More specifically assembly/machine language and mid level languages like C.\n\nSome questions I have are:\n\n1.How does assembly language make sense of bits of data? I understand that you have 32 bits and 64 bits based off registers that contain either a 0 or 1. These calculations are done extremely quickly by the processor(3 GHz) where multi-threading/hyperthreading/cores come into play. But what the heck do these calculation mean to the assembly language? Is it as something as computer calculating in a certain pattern = function\n\nExample) If the Calculations of these 64 bits = 100, 100, 200 then perform this OS task. If the Calculations = 200, 200, 100 do this other OS task?\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. These calculations/bits of data are also being temporarily stored on RAM? More applications/data processed = more that has to be temporarily stored on the RAM, right?\n\n3. Is POST test a low level/machine language programmed onto motherboard?\n\n4. Is there a difference between machine and assembly language?\n\n5. Chicken or Egg? Assembly language requires bits (electricity) coming through to do work? How are bits created? Where are they coming from? Electricity, right? How does the processor/motherboard/psu know how to turn electricity into these bits of data (0's or 1's)? Using circuits/transistors on the motherboard or code on the motherboard/processor cache?\n\nMaybe I just need to go to college for 4 years to learn computer science and electrical engineering lol\n\n**I'm looking for youtube explainer videos, websites, and books, even college level textbooks for stuff like CS 101 Intro to Computers or CS 300 Assembly/Machine Language, that I can read/watch to learn more about.

[Here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/eytmjo/dev_i_made_an_android_app_that_shows_the_most/)\n\nNow the scary part:\n\nThe traction died down after a couple of months. I expected it to honestly, as it was just a hobby project for me. And I wanted something nice on my Resume to get a job. And I did. But in September 2020, I started getting like a couple of downloads a day at least, from Russia. A couple of downloads turned into 4 the next month and now I am getting 5-7 downloads at least every day, all from Russia. Yesterday something ticked off and I got 33 downloads in a day. Today, I got 50 downloads. All from Google Play Search in Russia.\n\nI tried looking everywhere but I can't find the source of it. No post on Russian forums or youtube videos seems to exist where any sort of promotion might have occurred for my app. I am not promoting the app anywhere. No social media, no mass marketing, nothing.\n\nI am just concerned that people might be misusing it? How? I don't know. The idea in itself poses challenges to people's privacy and I am aware of it. Because people don't need to download my app to appear on it. They just need to use their regular Twitter and their retweet/post will just pop up on my app, being used by someone in their immediate vicinity. And this whole Russian downloads thing seems fishy to me somehow. Maybe a bad feeling.\n\nShould I be worried? Thinking of shutting down the app.\n\n[www.gettoaster.com](http://www.gettoaster.com/)",

    "postText": "What will be the next big thing in Computer Science? Hey everyone. Hope you\u2019re all safe and doing well. I\u2019m a dev with 2+ year of experience. I was hoping to get your thoughts on what will be the next big thing in software engineering? Reason I ask this- I\u2019m trying to figure out what will be in demand in the future (like currently its machine learning, data science, etc). I feel that the software development industry is getting a little saturated. I understand one way to stay ahead of competition is by really honing your skills. But a lot of times it\u2019s easier if you quickly learn whatever is the hype. Even if you\u2019re a newbie in a brand new industry you still have the opportunity to make 200k because you\u2019re like a pioneer in that industry. What are your thoughts about blockchain or augmented reality to be the future of software engineering? I\u2019m personally a little cynical about blockchain but I\u2019ve been reading articles about how blockchain is going to explode and devs who are investing the time to learn it right now will be on top of the food chain. Or will is it still going to be Machine Learning and AI?",

    "postText": "A Visual Introduction to the basic concepts of Graph Theory. Hello there!\n\nToday we will be diving into one of the most common ways of representing data and modeling problems (and solutions) in Computer Science. We will be talking about **Graphs**.\n\nThis will be the first of a series of posts introducing graph theory in a very visual way.\n\nIt will consist of some basic definitions of graph theory that will lay the basis for us to be able to explore more complex topics in future posts. The idea is to present the definitions along with visual representations, to help in the process of learning new concepts.\n\n**This is a summary version of the weekly edition of the Algorithmically Speaking newsletter. You can read the full article here:**\n\n[Algorithmically Speaking - #3: Nodes, Edges, and Connectivity](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory)\n\nLet\u2019s begin!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## Nodes, Edges, and Paths\n\nA **graph** consists of **nodes** and **edges**. We could see the nodes as the fundamental entities of graphs, and edges represent the relationships between nodes.\n\nOne good thing about graphs is that, even if they represent an abstract mathematical definition, we can visually display them using the most simple drawings of circles and lines.\n\nHere\u2019s a hand-drawn image of a graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges that we will we use to help us understand some basic definitions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0a1y8llz8kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=e13eb20bb4d163185d0b754ce8a619c2c6abd44a\n\nA **path** leads from node **a** to node **b** through the edges of the graph. The length of a path is the number of edges in it.\n\nThe highlighted (red) path between the two green nodes in the following image is of length 3:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a36yrzy09kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc22c26073857a8d5a773e081e7929af429c67f3\n\n>***Note****: The highlighted path is just one of the possible paths between the two green nodes. Try to identify every possible path between them.*\n\nA path is a **cycle** if the first and last node is the same. On the other hand, a path is called **simple** if each node appears at most once in the path.\n\nThe highlighted path in the previous image corresponds to a simple path, while the one in the following image is considered a cycle:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hpnn0bz39kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=c981d45b507ec9cddf18e3dbd1f445da167b9ff3\n\n## Connectivity\n\nA graph is **connected** if there is a path between any two nodes. For example, our initial graph is connected:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aldp6s2o9kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=315fd6168db76955c5f7469e63246228dd829857\n\n>***Try it yourself****: take any pair of nodes in the previous graph and check that, indeed, there is a path between them.*\n\nOn the other hand, the following graph is **not connected** because there is no path between the highlighted nodes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1wp2s2lakza1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=7684d57bebc41f14bfaf7b48cb67bb0284610563\n\nIn fact, there is no path between any node located in the right-bottom corner and any node located in the left-top corner.\n\nThe sets of connected nodes in a graph are called **connected components**. Here are the connected components (nodes with the same color) of the previous graph:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h049y5nnakza1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0495b2e55586068ba40a158dcd11fcbf9ccbd8\n\nWe can clearly see that this graph has two connected components.\n\nA **tree** is a connected graph that consists of **n** nodes and **n\u22121** edges. There is a unique path between any two nodes of a tree. You can also think of a tree as a connected graph that doesn\u2019t contain any cycles.\n\nThe following graph is a tree:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b29o042rakza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=2158bdac8f4013ed1f327e7a8129dc111dae5171\n\n>***Try it yourself****: take any pair of nodes in the previous graph and check that, indeed, there is a* ***unique*** *path between them.*\n\n## Direction and Weights\n\nA graph is **directed** if the edges can be traversed in one direction only. For example, the following graph is directed:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qduyg4btakza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bbd5eecbd306c9b5e207feab5fea676ed1bfc9c\n\nNotice how in the following image there is a path (more than one actually) between the green node and the blue node, but the opposite is not true. You cannot find any path starting in the blue node and ending in the green one:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x04bpvlkckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5a8f97b1f4d4e3610ce17aa6433008f7eeb7dd6\n\nAs we can see, the fact the graph is directed affects the concept of connectivity, which is called **strong connectivity** when we are referring to directed graphs. We will learn more about this in future posts.\n\nIn a **weighted** graph, each edge is assigned a **weight**. The weights are often interpreted as edge lengths.\n\nThe following graph is weighted:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/convruznckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b29d6107bf86ae4ecbf305c3602d1f01e609ece\n\nThe length of a path in a weighted graph is the **sum** of the edge weights on the path. For example, in the following graph, the length of the highlighted path between the green nodes is 13 (8 + 5):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orcc39orckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e069b59160b40f18f94ae7037b4f5d44cb1779\n\nIn future posts, we will explore algorithms related to connectivity, we will dig deeper into the importance of weights, and will learn some definitions that only make sense when we are talking about directed graphs.",

    "postTitle": "How to get a software engineering internship in 2019",
    "postText": "How to get a software engineering internship in 2019 So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.\n\nI\u2019m have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.\n\nWhether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.\n\nIf you prefer video format, here\u2019s a video I made covering these topics:\n\nYouTube channel: Matt Upham\n\nVideo: How to get a software engineering internship in 2019\n\nThe first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.\n\nThe second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \\[Insert college here\\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.\n\nThe best people in your network to reach out to are:\n\n\\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at\n\n\\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company\n\n\\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company\n\n\\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - \u201cfriends of friends who worked at \\[X company\\]\n\nThe next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don\u2019t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples\u2019 work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you\u2019ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nHi \\[person\u2019s name\\]!\n\nMy name is \\[your name\\], and I\u2019m an  \\[type of engineer\\]  in \\[location\\].\n\nI\u2019m reaching out because I applied to \\[company\\] regarding your \\[position\\].\n\nI have experience with \\[this technology, skill, etc\\]\n\nFollowing up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.\n\nWould someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \\[insert date to add time pressure\\]?\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\\[Your name\\]\n\n\\[Phone number\\]\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nFollowing up after they\u2019ve responded:\n\nWould you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\\[Your name\\]\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThe most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don\u2019t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.\n\nIf you\u2019ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them \u201cHow can I stand out in the intern application process for \\[X\\] company?\u201d, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you\u2019d be a good fit.\n\nAnother way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn\u2019t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:\n\n\\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)\n\n\\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section\n\n\\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)\n\n\\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them\n\nThe next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you\u2019ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won\u2019t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you\u2019ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you\u2019re ready to go because you know you prepared!\n\nThe final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There\u2019s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!\n\nI customized the funnel by tracking:\n\n1. Company Name\n2. Position Name\n3. Contact Name\n4. Contact Email\n5. Contact LinkedIn\n6. Date of Last Contact\n7. Job Source\n8. Job Posting URL\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!\n\nThe job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That\u2019s what will ultimately start you on your journey.",

It will probably take up a few weeks of content at most.\n\nAt the moment, I'm considering building an extendable genetic algorithm whereby the students can add their own methods for things such as selection (e.g., adding roulette).\n\nThe idea is to introduce GAs visually first, and so I am hoping to rely on something entertaining and intuitive (but somewhat abstracted away from them) for the GA itself. Something like this [genetic cars algorithm](https://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/) comes to mind.\n\nEssentially, my thoughts are that they will be learning by observing the baseline GA I provide to them, and then they will investigate and compare with each other by implementing their own mutation, selection, etc., and also tweaking factors such as the population size and number of generations.\n\nI thought it would be cool to provide some sort of history of the fitness graphs, so they can easily see how making such changes impacts the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n\nThese are just my ideas so far, but I would really appreciate any insight or suggestions.\n\nThanks :)",

In other words, not much experience programming with basic built in programming constructs. It could be someone who is coming from a functional programming language with no imperative programming experience.\n\nIf you understand the algorithms in CLRS and implement them in an imperative language, such as Python, then you will develop a library of models or chunks. These models or chunks, in turn, will help you solve future problems.\n\nSolving a problem you haven\u2019t seen before requires you to link existing chunks. So, the more chunks you acquire, the better problem solver you become.\n\nFrom a problem solving point of view a chunk can be seen as a solution. It can also be seen as a model.\n\nBy doing this you will become a better python programmer and since many imperative languages share the same programming constructs you will become a better programmer in general. In addition, you will learn how to analyze algorithms, which is part of the essence of programming. I read a research paper about what distinguishes great software engineers. One of the things these researchers learnt was that great software engineers pay attention to details; for example, they are attentive enough to implement efficient algorithms.\n\nSo, I think, if you have some mathematical sense, and you are willing to think hard, and lack imperative programming experience then I think CLRS is great book to study.",

Should be :\n\n\"Why aren't **UI applications** properly containerized and restricted since the earliest days of modern OSs\"\n\n# Introduction\n\nSince I have studied how computers, hardware and system work on the low level, I have been wondering why current systems that run user applications, even in 2021, have the design they have that is so inconvenient and dangerous IMO.\n\nI am an IT person with IT as a hobby since I am a kid. I may be naive about the business aspect or even technical aspect of all of this. I don't think I completely am, I would like to know otherwise.\n\nI am not pretending to give lessons to the people who designed Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux... I don't think I have the technical level nor the business understanding for that yet.\n\nI am however wondering why :\n\nWhy aren't desktop applications - in particuliar - properly containerized and restricted since the earliest days of modern OSs since it is technically possible ? Most of desktop apps don't require all the access they have at all.\n\nThe purpose of the post for me is to understand why *application engines* are, how they can be, how they can evolve, what they could be.\n\nI am open minded, so please be before reading. Also please be well aware of the technical aspects and or the business aspects of all of this. I am also mostly a Windows and Android User (I know already I'll get down votes for that...). I have at least a basic knowledge of Linux systems to. So therefore, I will mention *Windows*, *Linux* and *Android Linux* Often.\n\n(edit) I may sound arrogant with \"... since the earliest days of modern OSes\". I do not pretend to give lessons to people behind OSes, as mentioned in the original version of the post. The reason I wrote this is because the *protected mode* of Intel is used extensively by apps and OSes since 30-20 years and - I assume - could allow a much better isolation of apps (see bellow)\n\n# Technical facts\n\n* In a regular OS, an application capacities are the following :\n   * Use its non-special **CPU registries**\n   * **Access, read, write** its allocated virtual memory space (and never outside of this).\n   * That's it. They cannot ever do anything else (I/O: Network, Display, User input). Except by doing **system calls**.\n   * **System calls** are completely managed by the host OS. And therefore the host OS controls everything the application/process, sees outside its own memory.\n   * **Privilege levels** of a CPU (*^(it has nothing to do with privilege of users in Windows or Linux here)*) prevents any code to execute some CPU instructions, or to access some special registries like the registry that defines the virtual memory to physical memory mapping.\n   * System calls, virtual memory, privilege levels (not in the common meaning) are **CPU features**.\n* Of course exploits can be exceptions to all of this above.\n* Those CPU features are nothing new. [The first CPU to support such features was released in 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286#Features).\n\n# More technical assumptions\n\n* The OS is responsible for providing the API to applications.\n   * Therefore, a proper filtering of the system calls, could in theory, prevent any application to do harm to the rest of system.\n* It is easy to run containerized applications. CPU features of virtual memory, privilege levels and system calls have been allowing this since more than 30 years.\n* Those \"containerized\" applications can be arbitrarily restricted in using the OS features by filtering the system calls.\n\n# Current UI application engines flaws ?\n\nUnder Windows 10 for example, here is how to works :\n\n* Applications running with minimal privilege can :\n   * Access read / write my entire user folder at least\n   * Take screenshots\n   * Read my keyboard activity even when I do not have the focus on it.\n\nThere are only a access few fine tuning capabilities for Camera, Microphone, ect...\n\n**Why should any Desktop application with guess privilege users requires access to all of this ?** This is absurd.\n\nOf course some applications like CCleaner, a file explorer will need more special access, but these are more exceptions than common.\n\nCase of an application requiring to open a file or a folder are common but can very well be addressed without giving access to entire folders. A web app for example can ask for the browser to prompt the user for a file or a folder so the web app can access them.\n\nExamples of applications that do not require \"special\" rights to operate :\n\n* Web browser\n* Games\n* Multimedia streaming and player\n* Office applications\n* Messaging / Communications\n\n# So why aren't things like that instead\n\n**Given :**\n\n* The technical facts and assumptions above.\n* The advantages it would provide (UX, Security, Privacy)\n* That this do not look impossible at all to adopt in practice\n* This is technically really doable and rather easy (or it is not easy ?).\n\n**Things could be like that :**\n\n* Applications have their own dedicated folders. For example : (one for binaries, one for data/settings, one for cache so the system knows what can be cleaned up).\n* They cannot access or even see other folders except if an application requires its.\n* The OS is in charge of installing and updating the applications by fetching on the applications  repositories.Yes, it just works like that in Linux. But on Windows, it is a mess and rather looks like this :\n   * Applications check themselves for updates sometime running their own daemon for that.\n   * Applications have their own installer with UI ( sometime an .exe or an .msi file which is similar to package ?)\n* Any rights outside the above will be explicitly prompted to the user upon installation or on execution when requested. Android and iOS do this but sometime are not very specific IMO. They include :\n   * Use camera / microphone\n   * Use speakers\n   * Taking screenshots\n   * Using Network\n   * Automatically start at boot\n   * Read system information (Processes, Memory, Drivers, Storage, Devices...)\n   * Modify system settings\n   * Read data of X or Y application\n   * Interact with X or Y application\n* To import a file / folder, an application will send a message to the OS and the OS will prompt the user for a file / folder to import.Just like the web pages do it for the browsers.\n* An application may allow to be accessed by other specific applications without prompting the user.\n* Limit of resource usage (CPU, memory, storage, network throughput)\n\n**Advantages**\n\n* Better security against malwares\n* Better privacy\n* Better UX regarding application updates. Messages box like \"*A new update is available, would you like to...*\" at least would not happen for applications.\n* Such standardized containers could ease the use of saving your application settings (or even entire state ?) online, using the provider of your choice, potentially with zero knowledge.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\nIt might be a challenge for OS editors to define a proper application-to-system interface that :\n\n* Provides security for the system\n* Do not limit the possibilities of an application\n\n... and actually I can't see why how this is such a challenge.\n\n# But, what about : Web applications\n\nThe web (pages) is after all some kind of virtual machine, running on a specific interpreted language (HTML/CSS/JS).\n\nThis is already a well established solution to what I proposed above. Plus it runs on any CPU-platform because it is not machine code.\n\nThey run on a near-perfect isolation from each other and the rest of the system.\n\nMost applications nowadays are SaaS applications with a Web front-end.\n\nHowever we will still have need those non web applications. Web applications are also more resource expensive than non web applications.\n\n# But, what about : Docker\n\nDocker is a wonderful containers technology and is well established now. But is mostly used to run server side applications.\n\nIt is unofficially supported to :\n\n**Run UI applications with proper isolation**\n\nThere is an interesting article about running firefox on docker on linux. But it involves sharing the X11 socket with the container. That access can be harmful ?[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/running-gui-applications-on-docker-in-linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/running-gui-applications-on-docker-in-linux)\n\n**Run untrusted code safely**\n\nDocker is NOT official capable of running untrusted code safely[https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/107850/docker-as-a-sandbox-for-untrusted-code](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/107850/docker-as-a-sandbox-for-untrusted-code)\n\nThere are however some attempts (unchecked) :[https://blog.remoteinterview.io/how-we-used-docker-to-compile-and-run-untrusted-code-2fafbffe2ad5](https://blog.remoteinterview.io/how-we-used-docker-to-compile-and-run-untrusted-code-2fafbffe2ad5)[https://github.com/glotcode/docker-run](https://github.com/glotcode/docker-run)[https://fn.lc/post/docker-scratch/](https://fn.lc/post/docker-scratch/)\n\nTo build what I propose above, Docker might be a vert good start thou.\n\n# (Edit) More existent solutions\n\nSome comments mentioned a few interesting, existing techs :\n\n**iOS**\n\nDoes a really good a job in the permission of apps it seems. You may not like iOS for other reasons though\n\n**Snap package manager for Linux**\n\nAn attempt to containerize apps better. AFAIK it creates a real mess in the host OS file hierarchy\n\n**Qubes OS**\n\nInteresting\n\nAn OS that runs multiple VMs to isolate your apps\n\nPros :\n\n* You can run any app from any OS\n* More secused than containers\n\nCons :\n\n* But probably eats RAM and CPU for breakfast\n\n**BSD jails**\n\n**Universal Windows Platform**\n\n# Exploits ?\n\nExploits are potentially everywhere.Any hardware.Any OS.Any application engine of any type (Web, Container, native/traditional).\n\nIs it so obvious that a container running machine code in complete isolation is more likely to have dangerous exploits than a web engine ? Might sound like a stupid question but actually I don't think it is such an easy question.After all, an application engine with a full interface to run UI applications that runs machine code may not be as complex.",

The executive, who co-founded graphics-chip maker Nvidia, on Wednesday declared that \"Moore's Law isn't possible anymore.\"\n\nA key part of semiconductor manufacturing is shrinking the components called transistors, the extraordinarily tiny electronic switches that process data for everything from the clocks in microwave ovens to the\u00a0artificial intelligence algorithms\u00a0running in our phones.\u00a0\n\nLarge play-pause toggle\n\n00:1100:15\n\nLearn More\n\nVideo:\u00a0Nvidia CEO demos next-generation computer graphics at CES 2019\n\nIntel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 predicted a steady, two-year cadence of chip improvements that would double a processor's performance every couple of years. Moore's Law became more than a guideline for computer processor manufacturing. It's instead evolved into a shorthand definition for innovation at regular intervals, and has become a self-fulfilling prophecy driving the tech industry. Those regular improvements in iPhones, Samsung Galaxy smartphones and various other devices are thanks to Moore's Law.\u00a0\n\nBut as the scale of chip components gets closer and closer to that of individual atoms, it's gotten harder to keep up the pace of Moore's Law. It's now more expensive and more technically difficult to double the number of transistors -- and in return, the processing power -- for a given chip every two years.\u00a0\n\n\"Moore's Law used to grow at 10X every five years [and] 100X every 10 years,\" Huang said during a Q&A panel with a small group of reporters and analysts at CES 2019. \"Right now Moore's Law is growing a few percent every year. Every 10 years maybe only 2X. ... So Moore's Law has finished.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/moores-law-is-dead-nvidias-ceo-jensen-huang-says-at-ces-2019/\n\n",

Examples of this are computing IoU for object detection problems, training a model which can have parallelized updates, Non-Maximum Suppression, etc. I've learned that my ability to write fast code is really limited by whatever is available in Python: multiprocessing, asyncio when appropriate, standard scientific packages, or relying on others to write bindings to their custom cpp/cuda code.\n\nI would like to start building up my confidence to be able to know how to learn how to write very high performance scientific code, but I haven't been able to find many resources that exclusively focus on this.

The existing GCC backend is used to generate executable files, and COBOL source processing is separated into a separate interface developed by the project.\n\nSo far I know that the compiler successfully builds 100 examples from the \"Beginning COBOL for Programmers\" book, and support for ISAM and COBOL object-oriented extensions is planned to be added to gcobol in the coming weeks. Within a few months, gcobol's functionality is planned to pass the NIST benchmark test suite.\n\n**PART 2 Entry 19/04/2022 - New Cobol Interests** \n\nMajor corporations agreed to help pay and support a strategy to secure the open source software that supports their technology, which was submitted to the Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Threats and senior government authorities.\n\nA white paper explaining the entire proposal has been issued by the Linux Foundation and the Open Source Security Foundation it supports. The news release includes a description of topics that need to be addressed before, during, and after the software development process.\n\nThe proposal, for example, emphasizes the need to eliminate non-memory-safe coding languages in order to increase open source security. Languages like Cobol and C++ are faster and more efficient, but they are more vulnerable to specific flaws.\n\nIdentifying and auditing specific libraries, as well as sending incident response teams as needed, would all be part of the plan, which would be made easier by tools like a standardized software bill of materials.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "postText": "Why do email clients not have a protocol where you can add anti-phishing codes to each website you sign up to, so that the spam filter can catch phishing emails without correct codes? I had this idea. I'd like to know why it's not been implemented yet.  \n\n\nSo when you sign up to a website like Paypal.com for example you should be generated a random anti-phishing code. When you confirm your email address, the website sends this code to you in the email. Your email client then detects the anti-phishing code in the emails and says 'would you like to import anti-phishing code', you say 'yes, I would love to'; and then the email client adds it to a database of email addresses paired with anti-phishing codes.\n\nEvery legitimate email from Paypal will include the text \"Anti-phishing code: Xh7mnO22sXiWk92k\" for example, and when scammers email to say that 'You have been locked out from your Paypal account, please log in within 12 hours', the email client can check for the anti-phishing code, find it's not there or it's wrong, and send that email to junk.  \n\n\nI want to confirm that emails that contain the correct code would still need to be checked in the usual way; an email shouldn't just get green-lit purely because it contains the correct code, but those without the correct code should end up in junk.  \n\n\nWould this be feasible?",

By obsolete I mean not outpaced or outmatched by greater functioning competing devices, but as in entire loss of functionality, aka the computer doesn't work like it used to.\n\nLets say a computer retail store was swallowed in a landslide, and unsold computers in boxes remained unopened or used for decades or even a century. Additionally, the climate and environment surrounding the buried boxes did not corrode any worse than the natural life cycle of the electronics.   \n\n\nBecause the computers were not worn down by years of use and were in better condition, in which they their components aged without wear or excessive corroding, would the computers work just as well as if they were purchased and used around the same time as they were berried in the landslide? Would a computer from 2020 not function as well after spending it's unopened lifespan recovered from a landslide in 2040? what about 2120 or 3020?",

If that happens wouldn't we hear pause in the music when CPU switches the process?\n\nOr maybe more complex example.\n\nYou are watching a movie on Netflix... So there are many things happening \"at the same time\". So networking, audio, video decoding (which probably takes the most CPU power out of these 3 things)...\n\nSo how can the movie play without any interruptions? It's just hard to imagine... When the CPU switches from one process why do we not notice that and experience some sort of \"lag\"?\n\nIs that because our brains cannot \"process data\" that fast? \n\nSo If you would have device that could somehow record how CPU switches processes and then slow it down by factor of million would you be able to see/notice this lag that happens when the switch happens? Or at least if you would have a CPU that would perform 1000 operations per second instead of a few millions would you be able to \"see\" that behavior?",

    "postText": "Help me compile a list of the best orators teaching programming with empathy I have no difficulties finding answers for any question in programming or computer science. I have no problem finding hundreds of courses for any subject. But you know what's is difficult as hell? To find something that was made with empathy. Some videos, or course, or book that you not only understand, but you enjoy. Something that it feels like the creator consciously tried to put himself in the point of view of the person been taught. And succeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe majority of the videos/courses I can find, suffers from the same problem: superficiality, lots of speech bad habits like pauses, stuttering, irrelevant comments, that famous \"ahhhh...\" before every sentence, or even injecting advanced stuff while talking about basic concepts, without explanation (just because it's easy this way)...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get more and more disappointed the more videos I watch (specially on Youtube). And I am not speaking about the low rated content. I speak about videos with 2k likes, some others with 200k views, I speak about udemy and skillshare \"top\" content, stuff that was supposedly to be well elaborated before been published.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, apart from those above, there is what I called The Main Sin that a content creator can commit.\n\nSo, one problem that I can safely say I and you will encounter in 90 out of 100 videos in your next search is the lack of empathy. It seems like it is too hard for people to put themselves in other's people shoes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever that is crucial, because the whole goal of putting up a content to the public is to be understood and enjoyed by someone else with a very different point of view of the creator (the student). Most teachers tend to explain as they were explaining to themselves not to the other. Or they explain to an idealized student in their head, such student, I would say, happens to be (conveniently) smarter and advanced than the average out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, I know I gave no real examples here, no links. However that is a bit delicate because I don't want to point fingers on teachers that are not here to defend themselves. So I will have to leave things I bit blurry here.... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can point out some examples of good teachers. People who do not suffer from the problems I mentioned, and I hope after you watch some of their videos and then compare with the mediocre stuff you can easily find, then you will know what I am talking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne example is Derek Banas (Youtube channel): I think it would be a relief for millions of souls if every youtuber trying to tech something, were able to speak the way this guy speaks. He is able to cover every topic from beginning to end without breaking the flow (something that should not be so rare as it is, it should be the standard). He covers lot of topics in programming, so, just take a look.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is also Tony Alicea and his teaching about \"JavaScript under the hood\" (\"Javascript understanding the weird parts\", find it on Udemy or maybe Youtube). Let me explain why he is an example of a good teacher. Well, even though many people avoid speaking about this, deeply inside we know that most of courses offered by platforms like udemy, skillshare and others, are just people trying desperately to get their passive income. They are not talented, the are not committed to real teaching, the just want to spit out some content with minimal standards to be accepted by some course selling platform, and that is it. They love the passive income, not the teaching. However, when you watch Tony Alicea you clearly see how he is really doing his best to get out of his head and enter the mind of the student and that resulted in one of the best programming videos I have ever seen. It stood out (for me) for a very particular reason: the presence of empathy. I felt he was really explaining it TO ME, and not explaining to himself or to the idealized student in their head like 95% of teachers. Unfortunately he seemed to have stopped creating courses and videos. I hope he come back one day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother example is a guy called Widhi Muttaqien (Expose Academy channel). I encountered him while learning blender. He just proceed with the teaching without breaking the flow, without irrelevant comments, etc, but there was one aspect about his teaching that stuck: imagine when you are watching a lesson and it seems like the teacher is floating behind your head, reading your thoughts and them the video you are watching simply starts addressing exactly the doubt the just appeared in your head or was about to appear. Yes, the guy, unlike many teachers, he \"was present\" and in sync with the mind of the student. Again, this king of power only comes with empathy and he had it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast one: Joe Collins. Well, to be honest, I just watched one of his videos and it was yesterday. I need to refresh my shell skills, do some scripts, etc, and I stumbled upon one of his bash lessons. Again, I loved this guy just because he had that rare quality, the \"flow speaking\". Whenever I open a video and I watch a unbroken flow stream of words, I feel: \"this person respects the other\". And a format like this doesn't come by accident. One must consciously choose to to that, and it is harder because it requires empathy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to forget Uncle Bob of course, even though most of his videos are not specific, hands on code lessons, but a more general speech on some programming subject, I couldn't leave him out of the list since he is a terrific speaker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just mentioned a few, but of course there are a lot more out there that I don't know (and that's why I decided to post this). So guys, I implore, help me to expose these \"good teachers\" to the world so that it would not be so difficult to find them next time some poor student look for help. It seems like those damn algorithms are not doing their job very well, we need to help these bastards (the algorithms).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have a ocean of information nowadays, but content made with empathy is rare, and algorithms are \"not working\" for this. Lot and lots of highly rated content simply fails at empathy and \"speaking flow\", that's why we need to handcraft a list of \"best orators\" in programming with our hands and leave it here for posterity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks guys",

    "postText": "What were some basic aspects of computer science that you couldn't quite understand as you were learning? For me, there were a lot, mainly due to the fact that comp sci wasn't my focus in college (nor my interest at the time). As a computer engineering major, I had about 2 classes (Intro to Java, and C++). I had a lot of help to get through these courses and I mainly just memorized algorithms for tests because I couldn't comprehend anything. I got by with mediocre scores in those classes.\n\nHere were some things I couldn't quite understand, and I look back and laugh today:\n\n# Function placement\n\nI couldn't understand how a function was executed or called. The professor always just \"jumped\" to the function with no explanation as to how the computer just knew to jump there. What confused me even more is that he would sometimes write functions above or below a main program, and I had no idea what anything meant at that point. We never learned on a computer back in those days either (2000) and I had no concept of program flow as a result. So it was just pure random \"jump theory\" in my mind.\n\n# Function Parameters\n\nOften, the professor would write something like:\n\n    int sum(x, y) { \n        return x + y \n    }\n\nAnd then he'd have two variables:\n\n    int sum1 = 3 (sometimes int x = 3)\n    int sum2 = 4 (sometimes int y = 4)\n\nThen call that function with:\n\n    int mySum = sum(sum1, sum2) OR\n    int mySum = sum(x, y)\n\nI was so confused because I had no concept of variable scope, and I thought the parameter names had to be called x and y! But then why is he doing sum1 and sum2 sometimes? These confusions were never addressed on my end because no one could explain it to me at the time and all was lost. It wasn't until I hit 30 when I started to self teach myself, that I realized what was going on.\n\n# Find the Sum of 1 to 100\n\nThis simple concept in college was way over my head. Finding the sum of 1 to 100 is quite trivial, and is done like this:\n\n    int x\n    int y = 0\n    for (x = 1; x <= 100; x++) {\n        y = y + x \n    }\n\nBut the professor never explained that the variable y would retain the previous value and add to the counter. Obviously this method is a functional programming nightmare, however this is a simple way of teaching variable scope. But this was just not taught to me and I had no clue why the above function was summing numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nToday, I would solve that above problem in Javascript using functional techniques, like:\n\n    let y = [1..100].reduce((a, b) => a + b)\n\nImagine a professor trying to explain that one!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI was only 19 or 20 (today I am 41) when learning those concepts, but I do have to say the professors teaching those courses never took out a computer to show us how it was done, and it was pure theory. They assumed that we knew the proper control flow of how a computer program worked, but since I personally did not at the time, I was left with more confusion over comp sci than my calculus courses. It was just a big mess and because of the way comp sci was taught to me, I hated it for a full decade. I started self teaching myself 10 years ago, and now I absolutely love the topic, so it is a shame I was put off by this in college.\n\nSo my question: What comp sci topics gave you trouble while you were learning? Or what still does give you trouble?",

I went bonkers and spent 1 year doing  some 40+ courses from edX, coursera and udacity back then. Initial course offerings on these platforms were very (very) good and comprehensive. They also served well to kickstart mooc revolution.\n\nHowever It's been 8 years since then and I'm yet to see a good full blown course on Compilers, Language Theory (Automata) and Operating System. In my experience, Compilers by Alex Aiken (coursera -> stanford languita -> edx) is the only formidable course on the subject. CS262 by Westley weimer on Udacity was one of my favorites back in 2012, but it's shallow and introductory. I don't know why this is so. Even the compiler course (By Aiken) hasn't aged well. The toolkit for programming assignment (which is 80% of learning) is outdated and very difficult to work with.\n\nThere's a similar argument for Automata  and Operating Systems. There is a course by Ullman on Automata but it's not very comprehensible (no offense to Sir Ullman). Similarly, there are a few courses on OS on Udacity, but they aren't very comprehensive either.\n\nIn my experience, MIT has some of the best, most informative and comprehensive CS courses (on edX). Most of these courses have a detailed lab component and aren't water downed like others. We need a few such courses on the subjects like OS, Compilers and Language Theory. Courses with in-depth but easy to setup programming challenges that span for at least 10 weeks and cover the topic comprehensively.",

Stored in the stack.\n* Value types can be created at compile time and stored in stack memory.\n* Value type: if assigned to another variable, the value is copied directly and both variables work independently.\n* Reference type:\u00a0 contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the real data. Stored in the heap.\n* Reference types are used by a reference which holds a reference (address) to the object itself.\u00a0\n* Reference type: assigning a reference variable to another doesn't copy the data, but instead creates a second copy of the reference, which refers to the same location in the heap as the original value.\n* reference type examples: Classes, Objects, Arrays, Indexers, Interfaces\n\n**What is an Interface?**\n\n* an interface is a specification for a set of class members, not an implementation.\u00a0\n* an Interface is a reference type and it contains only abstract members such as Events, Methods, Properties etc.\u00a0\n* you can think of an interface as an abstract class that contains only pure virtual functions. This implementation of the methods is done in the class that implements the interface.\n\n Difference between an Interface and a Class\n\n* A class is a full body entity with members, methods along their definition and implementation.\n* An Interface is just a set of definitions that you must implement in your Class inheriting that Interface.\n\n Multiple inheritance in .Net\n\n* .Net does not support multiple inheritance. This is why Microsoft introduced Interfaces - a solution for multiple inheritance.\n* .Net allows you to have a single inheritance, but you are free to implement as many interfaces as you wish.\n\n**Static Keyword**\n\n* Static classes and class members are used to create data and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the Class. The keyword static can be applied to the classes, field, method, properties, operator, event, and constructors.\n* they cant be inherited and these classes are sealed by default. Normally it is used to group related static methods in class.\n* the advantage of static keyword is that it will make your code a bit faster since no object creation is involved.\u00a0\n\n**Jagged Array**\n\n* An array which has elements of type array is called jagged array. The elements cam be of different dimensions and sizes.\n* AKA an array of arrays\n\n**Namespaces**\n\n* namespaces are containers for the classes.\u00a0\n* Used for grouping the related classes in C#.\n* uses the \"Using\" keyword.\n\n**Polymorphism**\n\n* provides the ability to a class to have multiple implementations with the same name.\n* two types: static (compile time) and dynamic (runtime)\n* method overloading is an example of static polymorphism. Overloading is the concept in which method names are the same with a different set of parameters.\n* method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism.\n* method overriding can be done using inheritance. With method overriding it is possible for the base class and derived class to have the same method\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Inheritance is a concept in which you define a parent class and child classes.\n* the child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class, but at the same time, they can also modify the behavior of the methods if required. the child class can also define methods of its own if it needs to.\n\n**Encapsulation**\n\n* a process of binding the data members and member functions into a single unit. In c#, a Class is the real time example for encapsulation because it will combine a various type of data members and member functions into a single unit.\n* Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.\u00a0\n\n**Abstract Classes**\n\n* Abstraction is the process to hide the internal details and showing only the functionality.\n* The abstract modifier indicates the incomplete implementation.\u00a0\n* the keyword abstract is used before the class or method to declare the class or method to abstract.\n* an abstract CLASS is never intended to be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier *abstract*\u00a0in the class definition.\n* abstract classes cannot support multiple inheritance.\n* cant be static.\n* classes marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes\n\n**Front End Best Practices**\n\n* indentation\n* semantic elements: elements with tags that clearly deifne the content included for both the dev and the web browser.\n* class and ID names: using both class and ID names are practical and relevant.\n* CSS reset: resets html elements to a consistent baseline\n* avoid inline style CSS\n* when to use inline style: HTML email, content management system content (wordPress, etc.), Dynamic content (HTML created or altered by JavaScript), older websites.\n* popular javascript frameworks: Angular, React, jQuery, Vue.js\n* naming variables: always use variable names that make sense. Use camelCase.\n* Comments are very important\n* Design for all Browsers and Devices: Responsive Web Design\n\n**Back End Best Practices**\n\n* \u00a0Name things well: intelligent names, descriptive, tells us what the solution is\n* use properties, not public variables:\u00a0 there will be intences where you wont be able to use a public variable and will have to use a public property\n* methods should do one thing: separation\u00a0of concern\n* camelCase\n* keep it simple\n* concat strings using $\"\" (uses less memory space)\n* avoid global variables: use app.config for data. uses less memory and can be changed at runtime\n* Use public modifier only when necessary: public method can be seen by other classes outside of its own class. Private modifier : can only be seen in that class.\u00a0\n\n**Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index**\n\n* Indexing is a procedure that returns your requested data faster from the defined table. Without indexing, the SQL Server has to scan the whole table for your data. By indexing, SQL server does the exact same thing when you search for context in a book\u00a0 by checking the index page.\n* Clustered index : the type of indexing that established a physical sorting order of rows. Defining a column as a primary key makes that column the clustered the Clustered Index of that table.\n* Non-Clustered : an index structure separate from the data stored in a table that reorders one or more selected columns. The non-clustered index is created to improve the performance of frequently used queries not covered by clustered indexes.\u00a0\n* The differences:\n   * In a table there can be only one clustered index or one or more than one non clustered index\n   * In a clustered index there is no separate index.\n   * In a non-clustered index there is a separate index storage for the index.\n   * Clustered is slower than non-clustered.\n\n**http Protocols**\n\n* hyper text transfer protocol\n* the underlying protocol used by the internet that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.\n\n**Difference between http and HTML**\n\n* http is a protocol\n* HTML (hypertext markup language) is a language.\n\n**Dependency Injection**\n\n* DI is a design pattern that allows us to develop loosely-coupled code.\n* The intent of DI is to make code maintainable.\n* DI helps to reduce the tight coupling among software components.\n* DI reduced the hard-coded dependencies among your classes by injecting those dependencies at runtime instead of design time.\n\n**Entity Framework**\n\n* EF is the framework ORM (object-relational mapping) that Microsoft makes available as part of the .Net development.\u00a0\n* Its purpose is to abstract the ties to a relational database, in such a way that the dev can relate to the database entity as to a set of object and then to classes in addition to their properties.\u00a0\n\n**MVC**\n\n* Model View Controller is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representation of information from the way that information is presented to or accepted from the user.\n* used to develop web applications\n* Model = application core (database records etc); View = the display that the user sees; Controller = manipulated the data gathered by the model.\n* Advantages:\n   * Separation of Concerns.\n   * Multiple view support,\n   * Change accommodation ( because the model does not depend on the views, adding new types of views to the system generally does not affect the model.\n   * More Control\n* [https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/puranindia/ASP-NET-MVC-Interview-Questions/](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/puranindia/ASP-NET-MVC-Interview-Questions/)\n\n**SQL Stored Procedures**\n\n* prepared SQL code that you can save, so that the code can be resued over and over again.\n* you can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.\n\n**Stack vs Heap**\n\n* Stack = static memory\n* Heap = dynamic memory\n* The stack is more or less responsible for keeping track of whats executing in our code.\n* The Heap is more or less responsible for keeping track of our objects;\n* the stack is thought of like a stack of boxes and we can only access whats on the top of the stack and then throw it away.\n* anything can be accessed from the heap at any time.",

I've lost interest in a new language, say Haskell or Erlang, multiple times, because by the time I mow through the first 5 chapters, all I've learned is declaring variables and functions, but all my interest has been sapped out, with repetitive examples like fibonacci and factorials.\n\nI randomly stumbled upon exercism.io, and I found it really cool!\n\n* They have problem sets for all languages\n* They have a CLI tool, which means you can fetch exercises, and upload solutions without leaving your terminal, unlike say, codeforces\n* I assume there is some sort of graded difficulty, because the couple of problems I tried were 2-4 liners\n* They encourage a system, where people can check out each other's submissions and see different ways to achieve the same thing. They encourage you to participate, and leave comments/suggestions on other people's solutions. No one seems to care much for the easier problems, I'm not sure how good the community support is for the harder ones.\n* The problems are not algorithmic in nature. With algorithmic problems - you're only using basic primitives like arrays, loops and recursion, but the examples here require you to understand and interact with various libraries that come with the language.\n\nApologies if this is a fairly well-known platform, but I just came across it, and found it the best way to learn a new language as an experienced programmer.\n\n**Edit**: Typo in title, sorry, URL at the top of the post is the correct one.",

    "postText": "How do make a computer do calculus? The study of calculus involves continuous change, i.e. for any arbitrary function value, the adjacent function value cannot be described as a finite growth in in the function value. To put that simply, if you have a point (x, y) on a continuous curve, you cannot add real numbers (x+a, y+b) such that it corresponds to the next point. (Correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nThis is important, because in computing we do have a \"minimum value\" that can be added since infinitely small numbers do not exist. So when we work with calculus in computing, whatever value we get out is only an approximation. (Not including math programs that are made to parse derivatives/integrals to exact values). If I want to make a console app that takes f(x) = x and integrates it from 0 to some arbitrary value a, wouldn't the only easy way to do this be by creating a Riemann sum, i.e. rectangles under the curves, and get an approximation in accordance with the the (finite) limit of the sum?",

    "postText": "In 100 years will computer bugs decrease as software issues slowly get patched or will the need for new features increase bugs over time It seems to me a layperson that computer science tends to slowly standardize old commonly used features while many new features get stacked on top before they too get slowly standardized. With this process standardization software continues to get debugged and modified after its wide spread adoption due to zero day exploits and edge use cases. \n\nThis presents two competing forces in computer sciences (there might be many more I'm not considering) when it comes to how many bugs there are in software. On the one hand you have core software that carefully and slowly gets fully debugged and new software that provides new features and new bugs. \n\nIn the future, say 100 years, do you think software will get more and more bugs in it as it needs to continuously add in new features or do you think software will eventually get standardized enough and patched/debugged enough  to decrease bugs over time.\n\nPersonally I think software will for a number of years, perhaps 50 perhaps 150, get more and more bugs as new features need to get added to account both for new tech and for new societal wants and needs. Eventually though the majority of software will be standardized and the majority of the computer science field will be spend optimizing and improving existing software rather than writing new programs.\n\nNote: \n\nWhen I say software I mean all software in the totality of computer science\n\nI know the line between modifying existing software and making new software is blurry but I don't have a better way of expressing smoothing over existing problems vs adding new features that make new problems",

    "postText": "Hey /r/ComputerScience, I made a research paper recommender for Computer Science, and I would love for you to try it out! It uses embedding representation for each paper, so you can get recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations. Easy to run in Google Colab I made a research paper recommender for Machine Learning and Computer Science in general, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.\n\n###What is it?\n\nThe dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains 1,666,577 papers, mostly in the computer science field. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/B4qdoCC.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg\n\n\n###Where is it?\n\nGithub\n\nhttps://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/Research2VecPublicPlayGround.ipynb\n\nOr direct look to Google Colab\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0ggLs2r-5nWDWb-TNWqR2osaiXqNEsL\n\n###What can you do with it ?\n\nYou can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)\n\nNow, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:\n\nYou can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.\n\nYou can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). \n\nFinally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. \n\n**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** \n\n### How important is this ?\n\nWhen I was in R&D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.\n\nThere's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.\n\nI've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.\n\nEven the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.\n\n> \"As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough >enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.\"\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/\n\nSo if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.\n\nHere's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.\n\nWord2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651\n\nBinary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479\n\nExact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.\n\n###How do I use it ?\n\nHere's a quick video demonstration:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tlutFm1meMs\n\nI tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )\n\nHere's a step by step guide to help people get started\n\n**Step 1:** \n\nRun the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. \n\nhttps://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg\n\n**Step 2:**\n\nFind the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org\n\nGet either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link\n\nhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3\n\nThe Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'\n\nUse the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). If using the title to search, don't forget to use only lower case letters only. \n\nhttps://snag.gy/3yjx2o.jpg\n\nThe EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. \n\n**Step 3:**\n\nInsert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. \n\nhttps://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg\n\nIf you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change this line \n\n`extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 + paper3 + paper4`\n\nand create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction\n\n    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   \n    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) \n    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   \n    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) \n\nFinally, run Section 4 to get a TSNE map of the recomendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. \n\n**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** \n\n### Other details\n\nSo it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in May 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 20 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. \n\nAs of right now, the recommender has 1,666,577 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. \n\n### Feedback greatly appreciated !\n\nI am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit (kinda like Facebook SentEval https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval ) that I can use to tune the hyperparameters. \n\nThis feedback will also be helpful in my future plans, where I am planning on incorporating several other measures of similarity, and then use a attention mechanism to weight them for a final similarity. One method of content analysis I would really like to use is Contextual Salience https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08493. Another was something another Redditor just pointed out is cite2vec https://matthewberger.github.io/papers/cite2vec.pdf\n\nUsing a combo like this would help in one of the reoccurring hard search cases I encountered in R&D, which was trying to look up parameters of a particular method, when the method itself is not the focus of the paper. I was just actually encountering this issue when doing my project. I wanting to know more about what optimal hyperparameters others have found when working with embedding representations. This may not be the main topic of the paper, but it may have been described in the methods section of the paper. But this is hard to search for since paper searches mainly focus on the main subjects of the paper.\n\nOf course, I would very much appreciate whatever feedback, questions, comments, thoughts you have on this project. \n\n\n\n",

Perhaps I just haven't read enough, but given my understanding of how common errors are, not just with poorly written code but with random cosmic rays (among other things), how doesn't shit break all the time?\n\nThe Wikipedia article for [ECC memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory) gives a wonderful example of what's freaking me out:\n\n> A single bit is stuck at 1 due to a faulty chip, or becomes changed to 1 due to background or cosmic radiation; a spreadsheet storing numbers in ASCII format is loaded, and the character \"8\" (decimal value 56 in the ASCII encoding) is stored in the byte that contains the stuck bit at its lowest bit position; then, a change is made to the spreadsheet and it is saved. As a result, the \"8\" (0011\u20091000 binary) has silently become a \"9\" (0011\u20091001). \n\nMost consumer computers (hell, most consumer electronics period) don't use ECC memory. So how the hell do things go a couple days without breaking entirely? Sorry if it's a dumb question \ud83d\ude05",

    "postText": "How does \"Engineering a Compiler\" (by Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon) compare to the Dragon Book (Principles of Compiler Design by Alfred Aho and Jeffery Ulman)? Hey everyone, So I have been thoroughly and religiously studying Compilers for a couple of months now. In addition, to the Dragon Book, I have been taking video lectures and exploring through slides online that have been compiled (no pun intended) by people that have worked with the compiler technology for years. So anyway, I have familiarized myself with all the basics (Scanning, Parsing (including generating parse trees and ASTs), and even code generation, as well). I have a good understanding of the complex algorithms involved in some of these stages, and I have a good intuition on the complexity involved in all this (in particular, I understand what problems are undecidable for a programmer. What are the pros and cons of different techniques and so on). \n\nSo anyway, one of the lecture series that I watched had taken upon \"Engineering a Compiler\" as their reference book, and I have explored some portion of this book (of course, I am still at the very beginning), and my initial thoughts are: \n\n\\- This book comes across as very beginner-friendly \n\n\\- I like how it builds from the basics. So, for example, while constructing a scanner, we get to see the application of finite-state automata in action. So the book tells us how to go from a regular expression to non-deterministic finite automata using Thompson's construction algorithm and how all this process leads us to recognize words. We get to learn about this process within the first 50 pages of the book. In contrast to this, the dragon book jumps straight into the more complex stuff (such as writing context-free grammar, building a syntax-directed translator, and some other notions from a parsing point of view). In other words, it seems to skip a lot of stuff at the beginning that should have been introduced before we had jumped into the more complex stuff. \n\n\\- As mentioned above, \"Engineering a Compiler\" takes a very programming-oriented approach. It is easier to comprehend things from a coding point of view, and it is convenient to map the theory into actual practice.\n\n\\- The notion of \"Classic Expression Grammar\" is introduced in a very beginner-friendly manner in that book. \n\nAnyways, I am still in the process of learning and exploring as much as I can, so I am not sure how much weight and value my opinion carries. I am reading up on both texts. In my opinion, the Dragon Book is very detailed, in the sense that each sentence can be a book on its own at times, but \"Engineering a compiler\" seems more beginner-friendly. One more thing that I have heard people say is that some of the optimization techniques presented in the dragon book are a bit outdated, but I am still looking forward to reading about that. \n\nAnyways, these were just my two cents on both these books. Now, why do I ask this question from you guys? I would love to get some insights from a professional or someone more educated on this stuff. Also, if you find any misconceptions in the above passage then feel free to correct me on that. I come here to learn more.",

I've pondered about this for a while so I will give a simple example in C++:\n\nint x = 65;\n\ncout << x;\n\nMy understanding is that the compiler converts that to 1s and 0s and stores it in memory (integers take up 4 bytes, so it should be something like this - 01000001 and the rest of the bytes are filled with zeros).\n\nWhen we call the variable x, the computer must find where it's stored in RAM and that's where things get confusing for me. I have asked a few people and the answer always seems to be that the compiler will figure it out but no explanation is provided about that process.\n\nI imagine the compiler must keep information about the data type somewhere, like a data table:\n\naddress 201 - integer\n\naddress 206 - char\n\netc...\n\nI would appreciate it if someone could confirm how this works because it's an integral part of how computers operate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nJust to clarify, I am asking how the computer knows that it should interpret this pattern on 1s and 0s as a number and not as a character?

    "postText": "An Introduction to Algorithms, Pt. 4: The TSP and Heuristics Welcome to the fourth part of my introductory series on algorithms for computer science students and self-taught developers. I know that this can be a tricky and intimidating topic, so I've done my best to break everything down and make it as accessible as possible. If you're new to the field, struggling with some of these concepts, or if you just need a refresher, this is for you.\n\n# An Introduction to Algorithms, Pt. 4: The TSP and Heuristics\n\nHave you ever wondered how long it would take to visit every city in the world? Or how to plan a road trip that minimizes travel time and cost? Perhaps you're curious about how biologists sequence DNA molecules containing millions of base pairs. These optimization challenges are all related to a classic problem in computer science known as the **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**. Traditionally, it asks: *given a list of cities and the distances between each pair, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point?* Answering this question is not easy. In fact, the TSP belongs to a select subset of problems classified as NP-hard because there is no known algorithm that can optimally solve any and every instance of them in reasonable (a.k.a., \"polynomial\") time.\n\nIt is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization, and it has many practical applications in planning, logistics, manufacturing, biology, and astronomy. In your academic and professional career, you will encounter several common variations.\n\n**First, a given instance of the problem can be symmetric or asymmetric**. In a symmetric TSP, the distance between two cities is the same in both directions, meaning that the cost of traveling from city A to city B is the same as traveling from city B to city A. In asymmetric instances of the TSP, the distance between two cities varies depending on the direction of travel -- potentially due to one-way streets, traffic conditions, or different modes of transportation. **Another way to classify TSPs is by their completeness**. A complete TSP has a direct route between every pair of cities, so you can travel between any two without stopping. On the other hand, an incomplete TSP has some missing routes between cities, possibly because of physical barriers, such as mountains or oceans. Each variation presents a unique challenge that affects the algorithms and heuristics required to find an efficient solution.\n\nNow that you're familiar with the TSP, it's time to explore some tangible examples designed to illustrate the problem and solidify your understanding.\n\n**TSP Example #1: Symmetric, Complete with Four Cities**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6fqpwnai7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd0a0ed023a7f300355d23afb818f49c78acaa5e\n\nWe will start with a symmetric, complete TSP involving four cities: A, B, C, and D. In this instance, the distances between cities are the same in both directions, and there is a direct route between every pair of cities.\n\n[A Symmetric, Complete TSP \\(not to scale\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahmb4j1o7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5380cf6487e2798d7e4676ccf1e54891a5a19f1e)\n\nGiven the limited nature of this TSP, we can determine the optimal solution using **a brute-force approach**. In the brute-force approach, you identify every possible route that visits each city. Calculate the total distance for each one. Then, choose the shortest. This approach is guaranteed to produce the optimal solution, but it comes at a high computational cost because the number of possible routes increases factorially with the number of cities.\n\nIn our four-city example, there are only six possible routes. However, in instances of the TSP involving ten cities, that number skyrockets to 362,880. And for problems involving a mere 20 cities, there are 121,645,100,408,832,000 possible routes. To put these numbers into perspective, even with a computer capable of evaluating one route every millisecond, it would still require over 3.8 million years to check every possible route in a 20-city TSP. That is shocking, and it highlights the limitations of a brute-force approach.\n\nNevertheless, it remains a valuable tool for understanding the TSP and establishing a foundation for more efficient algorithms. A brute-force approach is also appropriate for solving relatively small TSP instances. So, without further ado, here is a visual depiction of the solution to our first example:\n\n[Visualizing a Brute Force Approach](https://preview.redd.it/1p7lcqrz7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=58b82f046e067c76912a203dd89a2d03a7df9da6)\n\nAs you can see, six distinct routes take you from a given city (in this case, city \u201cA\u201d) to all other cities, and back to your city of origin. Now, let\u2019s calculate the total distance required to traverse each one of these routes to determine the optimal solution.\n\n[Calculating the Total Distance](https://preview.redd.it/cxxjd2v28nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6339f31f25a3093bccb654957376024c87aef5)\n\nThe optimal solution is the tour A-B-C-D-A, or its reverse A-D-C-B-A, with a total distance of 152 km. In symmetric, complete instances of the TSP, there are always two identical, optimal solutions because the distance between two cities remains the same regardless of the direction of travel. Next, you will evaluate an asymmetric, incomplete instance of the TSP and solve it with brute-force methods.\n\n**TSP Example #2: Asymmetric, Incomplete with Four Cities**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4p3l7al88nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a9a882bccc8b65675608582c050b15a111abe8\n\nAs promised, an asymmetric, incomplete TSP involving four cities: W, X, Y, and Z. In this instance, the distance between cities varies depending on your direction of travel, and there is no direct route between city Y and city Z.\n\n[An Asymmetric, Incomplete TSP \\(not to scale\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahegkleb8nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=728b0700788d1ae335a49339a5e8337419969a4e)\n\nTo account for the lack of a direct route from city Y to city Z, we will approach this TSP in a non-traditional manner that allows for revisiting cities. This example highlights the complexities of real-world instances of the TSP and the limitations of its traditional rules.\n\nTry to find the optimal route using a brute-force approach before reading my solution, and embrace this opportunity to solve a practical, tricky instance of the TSP that requires you to think outside the box. Remember, the shortest route might involve retracing your steps to ensure all cities are in the tour.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to start, answer the question: *What is the fastest way to get from city Y to city Z and vice versa?*\n\nAfter you have tried to solve this problem, read my solution and compare your approach to mine. Answer the following questions as you evaluate your solution:\n\n1. Did you find the shortest route?\n2. What challenges did you face while solving this problem?\n3. What did you learn from this exercise?\n4. How difficult would it be to apply this brute-force approach to an instance with five or six cities?\n\nAnswering these will help you to gain a deeper understanding of the TSP and its many variations.\n\nGood luck.\n\n**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nDo not read on until you\u2019re ready to compare my solution with yours. This exercise will help you learn and become a more proficient problem-solver.\n\n**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A Partial Visualization of the Brute Force Approach](https://preview.redd.it/k0svpvgecnwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d04be94835c08d4ebd64b8d9fe9534bb6e71833)\n\nAs a starting point, you may have selected city \u201cW\u201d and identified unique routes that limit the need to revisit cities. If so, you produced a series of routes similar to the ones depicted above. This approach is reasonable, and if you went on to calculate the total distance of each one of these six routes, you would have produced a table like this:\n\n[Calculating the Total Distance](https://preview.redd.it/vdbpx6azwqeb1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7063b14b3dd1d01deec0053d5de35f037dfe8530)\n\nIf you stopped there, you might be thinking that the optimal solution is the route W-X-Y-X-Z-W, which has a total distance of 105 km. But, you would be wrong. The most efficient routes can be found by treating city \u201cX\u201d as a fulcrum and revisiting it after every stop, which would lead you to something like **X-W-X-Y-X-Z-X**. One of the truly optimal routes, which has a **total distance of 100 km**. \n\n**TSP Example #3: A European Tour with 12 Countries**\n\nIn our third and final example, we have a larger symmetric, complete TSP that involves 12 countries.\n\n[This table shows the approximate distances \\(in kilometers\\) between 12 European countries that form a symmetric and complete instance of the TSP.](https://preview.redd.it/9vh00h9tcnwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df7aed11a5da4b42a7d9beb2eba8c8af3390f55)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3izwvvzcnwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=87a89d3d511da90ec77490d3d0938641b5d776ef\n\nIt is unreasonable to apply brute-force methods to this example. There are 39,916,800 unique routes, and even if we took its symmetric nature into account and cut that number in half\u2026 19,958,400 remain. But wait, what if we had a powerful computer capable of evaluating one route every millisecond? It would still take \\~5.5 hours to determine the optimal solution. That is unacceptable.\n\nFortunately, we can leverage the power of **heuristics** when we encounter problems like this. Heuristics are problem-solving techniques that use shortcuts, rules of thumb, or practical approaches to find approximate or \u201cgood-enough\u201d solutions to complex problems more quickly and efficiently than exhaustive methods. They prioritize speed and simplicity over optimality and often trade a guaranteed, best solution for one that is close enough or satisfactory, especially when dealing with computationally expensive problems. They are invaluable.\n\nOne popular heuristic for the TSP is **the nearest neighbor** algorithm:\u00a0\n\n1. Start at a city (the current city).\n2. Mark the current city as visited.\n3. Find the unvisited city nearest to the current city.\n4. If there are no unvisited cities left, go back to the starting city and terminate the algorithm. Otherwise, set the nearest unvisited city as the current city and return to step 2.\n\nThe nearest neighbor algorithm is a greedy heuristic, which means that it makes the best local choice at each step. Of course, this series of locally optimal decisions does not guarantee that the final solution will be optimal or even close to optimal. Sometimes it overlooks shorter routes because they involve visiting cities that are not the nearest neighbors at some point. Its primary advantage is that it is easy to implement and execute quickly.\u00a0\n\nTwo key variables affect the quality of the solution produced by the nearest neighbor algorithm: (1) the choice of starting city and (2) the distribution of distances between cities. We will focus on the choice of starting city because it\u2019s a variable we control. While there is no definitive method for selecting the perfect starting city, there are some popular strategies worth considering:\u00a0\n\n1. Start with a random city, execute the algorithm multiple times, and choose the best solution from the results.\n2. Choose a city close to the geometric center of all the cities.\n3. Select the city that has the smallest average distance to all other cities.\n\nExperimenting with these strategies can help you optimize the nearest neighbor algorithm\u2019s performance and generate higher-quality solutions.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to apply this heuristic to our 12-Country European Tour. If we naively choose city A, Portugal, as our starting city, we will visit countries F, K, H, J, C, L, E, I, D, G, and B in order of their proximity to one another, using the distance data provided. After we visit every country, we will return to Portugal to complete the tour. This na\u00efve route requires us to travel a total distance of 16,000 km.\n\nWhat if we choose a more strategic starting point, a country close to the geometric center of this TSP, a country like Germany? By beginning our tour in Germany, country I, we will travel to countries K, H, J, C, L, E, B, G, D, F, A, and then back to I. This route only requires us to travel 12,900 km\u200a\u2014\u200a3,100 km less than our na\u00efve route. A notable improvement!\n\nAs you can see, the choice of starting city can significantly impact the efficiency of the nearest neighbor algorithm. Remember this, and do not hesitate to experiment with different strategies in an effort to optimize your solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Traveling Salesperson Problem is a fascinating and complex optimization problem that has captivated the minds of many brilliant mathematicians and computer scientists. Its widespread applications in planning, logistics, manufacturing, biology, and astronomy make it an essential problem to study and understand.\n\nThroughout this article, we explored the limitations of brute-force methods and the power of heuristics like the nearest neighbor algorithm, but the truth is that there is so, so much more for you to learn. As you continue to study computer science, you will encounter other heuristics (e.g., insertion algorithms) to help you more effectively solve the TSP and other complex, intriguing problems. Whatever you do, never stop learning, and remember that sometimes the most elegant solutions are the ones that prioritize simplicity and practicality.",

    "postText": "What is the minumum info you need to tell if an object is a circle? So basically I have a program that runs through an image of objects and is supposed to count the number of cirlces. I can more or less accurately detect all objects and store the following results of each object:Area(number of pixels), xPosition, YPosition and like the bounds.\n\nI tried differentiating circles from non-circles by assuming every object was a circle, finding the radius and using pi\\*r\\^2 to get the area. If that area matched the number of pixels then it was a circle.\n\nHowever this leads to a few errors. Such as when an object takes up the same area as a circle would but is not a circle.\n\nAny idea's as to what I can try? It also fails in the noisy cases since my algorithm doesnt save pixels that are dark (Which is counted as like the background)\n\nEdit: (Further Detail)  \n Right now, I scan through the image and look for  pixels that arnt a black background. Then I scan through the object(neighboring pixels) but I  dont store each pixel,  I only store the minumum x-value, max x-value,  min y and max y. And the number of pixels.\n\nThis  allows me to calculate the radius, diameter etc. So right now I can  only get the diameter in the X-direction and Y-direction.",

I am currently an undergrad computer science major and I usually have to completely programming problem sets for classes every week or every other week. I find that when I am first given the problem set, I read through the description and then immediately try to jump into coding. This usually ends with me spending hours on a complicated solution, getting stressed out since it takes forever to run, is messy and buggy while my friends usually have a more methodical approach to problems and write better code.\n\nMy question to you all is could you please walk me through your process of reading a programming assignment all the way to the end of coding it. Do you start with a pen and paper, do you draw things, do you write psuedocode out first? I'd love to rebuild my problem solving strategy into something that is more well though out and wanted to hear some good problem solving tips from you!\n\nLooking forward to hearing your responses :)",

    "postText": "How do you approach logical problems (when designing algorithms)? I am a 2nd year cs student and with the current programming experience I have, I've noticed that my approach to logical problems seems to be quite \"random\". Often I will simply attempt a solution by writing a function/program that I think will work - I seem to try to figure it out as I go along. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile this approach does get me through simpler problems, it breaks down on more complex ones. When approach a more complex problem, usually one that is too large to keep track of mentally, I seem to start going in circles. I start by trying to solve one part of the problem, but then I realise that some other part needs to be solved before I solve this one, so I move on to the other part. This usually ends with me going in circles whilst trying to figure out a solution - I get stuck because I can't comprehend the problem as a whole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a good example where I encounter this issue: I have been programming using a language called scheme, which is purely functional. One of the tasks that I was set was to reverse a list. This was fine; I wrote a procedure which worked on the first try. This was a problem that I could \"store\" in my head in its entirety. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, there is an extension of this task. You have to write a new procedure which reverses trees (lists containing lists containing lists etc). This means that each element in each list needs to be reversed: ( (1, 2) , (3, 4) ) would become ( (4, 3) , (2 1) ). When attempting a solution to this problem, I frequently found myself going in circles. For example, I'd solve part of the problem - reversing innermost elements in a list, but then I would realise that I can't do that first because I lose track of where I am in the tree. So I would take a different approach: trying to first reverse highest level elements. This would lead to another issue, which would lead to another... eventually leading me back to my starting point. I think that this is because I can't see the problem as a whole in my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would like to be able to approach problems such as these in a more systematic manner, as opposed to a seemingly random approach. I want to know if there is a better technique that I can use to solve such problems or if it's simply a question of practicing until you can comprehend what's going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've included my solutions to each reversing algorithm (the tree reversing one doesn't work yet).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nList reverse:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(define (reverse-list \\_list)\n\n  (define (reverse-iter old-list new-list)\n\n(if (null? old-list)\n\nnew-list\n\n(reverse-iter (cdr old-list) (cons (car old-list) new-list))))\n\n  (reverse-iter \\_list (list)))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTree reverse:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(define (deep-reverse tree)\n\n  (define (deep-reverse-iter old-tree new-tree)\n\n(cond ((pair?

    "postText": "How the Fast Inverse Sqrt trick works and how you can come up with fast power, exp, log, and other methods. This may be a bit dated, but going through my adolescence in the mid to late 2000th, the revival of the [fast inverse sqrt method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root) and the air of mystery surrounding this strange number, 0x5f3759df, made it one of those things where anyone who would ever dare to call themselves a programmer would know the reference to. Trying to understand this method, and its magical constant, was sort of my white whale. It wasn't until 2014, right after I graduated from college, that I finally understood how the method came about. It's actually deceptively simple, and I think that anyone, with a bit of luck, could have come up with this constant.\n\nIn fact, you could even create up constants for the sqrt, inverse cube root, and any rational or irrational powers. You can also use a similar technique to create approximations of exp, log, and geometric means.\n\nThe fast inverse sqrt method is essentially this approximation:\n\n\n    float invsqrt(float y) {\n      int i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking\n      i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? \n      return * ( float * ) &i;\n    }\n\n\nin essence, it seems like if you take the bitwise IEEE 754 representation of the float y, as a 32bit integer, divide it by 2 (the left shift by 1), then subtract it from 0x5f3759df, and finally treat it as a float again, then you somehow get a value that seems to approximate 1/sqrt(y), with up to 10% relative error for the range of floating point numbers.\n\nWhy?\n\nTo answer this question, let's start with some simpler notations. We'll use the function float2int(y) to denote the conversion that takes in a IEEE 754 floating point number, and outputs its machine representation as a 32bit int; basically what the first line does. We'll also define the inverse function int2float(i) that performs the reverse conversion. Obviously, float2int and int2float will be inverses of each other.\n\nNow, the question is why int2float(0x5f3759df - float2int(y) / 2) approximates the inverse sqrt function.\n\nWell, this is where the luck comes in. Assuming that you got curious and started looking at the function\n\n    f(y, m) = int2float(m - float2int(y) / 2)\n\nand you have a plot where you can fix an arbitrary constant m, and plot out the curve for f(y, m) in terms of y, what would you see?\n\nWell, as luck would have it, you can [try this out](http://www.phailed.me/2014/10/0x5f400000-understanding-fast-inverse-sqrt-the-easyish-way/#Adding%20Alpha).\n\nIf you plot the curve for just invsqrt(y) on the same graph, you'll notice that, as you vary m, your function is just a multiplicative factor away from invsqrt(y). That is, f(y, m)/invsqrt(y) is linear-ish, and your task is to find the value of m that makes this ratio go to 1 (or as close to 1 as you can manage for as many values of y as you can manage).\n\nSo how do we solve this problem? Well, the way that the original authors did was to treat this as a boundary value problem; e.g., use some value of y that simplifies the equations as much as possible. Their choice was to set y = 1 at one end of the boundary:\n\n    1 = f(1, m)/invsqrt(1)\n\nthis simplifies to\n\n    1 = int2float(m - float2int(1)/2)/1\n\nand recalling that int2float and float2int are inverses, we have\n\n    float2int(1) = float2int(int2float(m - float2int(1)/2)/1)\n      = m - float2int(1)/2\n\nwhich gives\n\n    m = 1.5 * float2int(1)\n\nI'll save you the troubles of computing `float2int(1)`, it is 0x3f800000, so, to satisfy the boundary condition, the magic constant would come to be `1.5 * 0x3f800000 = 0x5f400000`.\n\nThis is very close to the 0x5f3759df, so how do we close the gap? Well, it turns out that if you graph the errors of this plot, you'll notice that the error is always positive. As a result, if you just subtract a little bit off of 0x5f400000, you can actually halve the absolute value of the error by shifting half of the error down into the negative side. Finding the optimal constant is then a simple task of bisecting through viable constants while minimizing the maximum absolute value of the relative error.\n\nThis method also generalizes to arbitrary powers. It turns out that for any power, c, you can approximate y^c by\n\n    int2float(0x3f800000 * (1 - C) + C * float2int(y))\n\nAnd finally, with a bit of analysis, you can also derive analogue laws for exp and logarithms, e.g. in https://github.com/leegao/float-hacks#exp-redux.",

For things like ASCII characters, there is a 2D array of pixels that can be used to draw a sprite.\n\nHowever, I recently watched [this video](https://youtu.be/gsZiJeaMO48) on ray tracing. He describes placing a camera/observer and a light source in a three dimensional plane, then drawing a bunch of vectors going away from the light source, some of which eventually bounce around and land on the observer bitmap, making the user's field of view.\n\nI sort of knew this was the case from making [polygon meshes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Dolphin_triangle_mesh.png) from 3D scanning/point maps. The light vectors from the light source bounce off these polygons to render them to the user.\n\nAnyways,\n\n1. In video games, the computer doesn't need to recompute every surface for every frame, it only recomputes for objects that have moved. How does the graphics processor \"know\" what to redraw? Is this held in VRAM or something?\n\n2. When people talk about computer graphics being \"triangles,\" is this what they're talking about? Does this only work for polygonal graphics? \n\n3. Are the any other rendering techniques a beginner needs to know about? Surely we didn't go from bitmap -> raster graphics -> vector graphics -> polygons.",

From my understanding a loading screen occurs when you want to load in new textures, maps, audio, AI, etc. from a hard drive (or some storage equivalent) into RAM. \n\nGiven that the whole goal is to free up space to send all of this data to RAM, aren't loading screens taking up unnecessary space? Sure a blank screen with a loading bar doesn't seem too expensive, but what about games such as [Assassin's Creed](https://youtu.be/SC5OI7ifk6U) where your loading screen is an interactive map you can walk around in? Or [Skyrim](https://youtu.be/voDDEdeW5U0) where you have 3d-rendered models you can scan around?\n\nMy guess is that the GPU is idling as there is currently nothing to display or compute to the screen, so some leeway for graphics might be given there. Still, wouldn't you also need to load these loading graphics, physics, and animations into RAM as well as take it out at some point?\n\nI'm just curious so some dialogue, information, or papers on this stuff would be pretty cool. \n\nThanks.",

My health took a huge downturn last year, which I almost died from. While recovering, I realised I wasn't doing what I really wanted to be doing. So I'm about to take on a certificate in Computer Science & IT at Open Uni, with a view to working on a degree in software development. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips or advice?\n\nE.g. handy kit or apps to practice with. I've been working with a Mac for several years too (don't hate on me for it!), so I need a PC again. I'd like something that can handle all my needs, but I'd prefer to keep costs to a minimum as I'm also buying a house this year. \n\nThanks in advance. ",

    "postText": "algorithm for finding shortest non-overlapping paths between multiple sources and destinations preface: this is for a factorio mod, not for homework.\n\n####Technical question\nI'm pretty sure this is NP-hard, but does anyone have any thoughts on how to find the mutually cheapest path from two (or more) sources to their specific targets - *s^1* to *t^1* and *s^2* to *t^2* (etc up to *n*) where a given node can only be on one path.\n\nI originally was looking at stuff like A*, but now I think that the problem generalizes to the [minimum cost flow problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem), with every edge has a capacity of 1 (and varying costs b/c of game details).  I think I can set up the problem by creating one source *s^0* with edges to each _s^i_ and one target *t^0* with edges from each *t^i*, and looking to find a flow of *n* from *s^0* to *t^0*.  Does this make sense?  \n\nWhich algorithm would be best for this problem?  I don't really know which algorithm is most efficient for this problem in general (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_simplex_algorithm?), and I know my specific use case would have massively more nodes and edges than in the solution.  Would that mean that a different minimum flow algorithm or pathfinding algorithm is better?\n\nBecause of game details, some nodes change in circumstances (see the \n   \n\n####Factorio details\nFactorio is a game on a cartesian coordinate grid.  It uses conveyor belts to move items from place to place, in any of four directions.  These conveyor belts take up space, and two conveyor belts can't sit in the same spot.  Factorio has undergound belts, that attach to conveyor belts and travel below the ground for up to a certain distance in a straight line.  Underground belts are more expensive (and look less nice), so we try to avoid them when possible (but only if it's not better than normal belts).\n\nNormal belt (S=source, B=belt, U=underground belt start/end, T=target, W=wall or obstruction):\n\n    .SBBBB..    \n    .....B..  \n    .....B..    \n    .....BT.    \n\nUnderground belt\n\n    .SBU.WUB..    \n    .....WBB.  \n    .....WB..    \n    ... .WBT.\n\n\n\nI think this can be graph G=(V,E) where each node is a coordinate on the graph that doesn't already have a building in it, and each node has edges that can be reached by a single belt or underground belt.  One complication is that an underground belt can't turn on the same tile it comes out - it has to continue forward for at least one tile.  I *think* this could be incorporated into the graph, but I'm not sure how.  \n\nThe mod BeltRouter (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BeltRouter) will automatically route conveyor belts for you, using the shortest path.  It even allows you to do multiple belts at once! However, it does these one at a time, so the first path can get in the way of the second path.  I'm looking for ideas on how to solve this.  \n\n\nThank you!  Happy to clarify anything, I appreciate any insight into this.\n\nAs a side note, does anyone know of an easy way to visualize shortest path algorithms that lets you use a custom algorithm, preferably in Python?",

    "postText": "I think I am going to fail Calc II. What can I do better? I'm here because I love math, and I want to get into grad school for pure math, but my grades are really worrying, and my GPA is not excellent to begin with. The average for the class right now is 50%, which is a failing grade, and the instructor is not planning on curving it. On our most recent midterm, students got an average of 5.6/15 on the long-answer section. 30-40% of the class has already dropped out or are not showing up to class. We had a full house at the beginning of the semester, it was hard to find a seat, but now it seems like 50% of the students attend on any given day. \n\nThere are some issues I have with the professor's teaching style (he does not do examples in class, all of his class notes are sloppily scrawled on a piece of paper which he puts up on the projector. I don't find that the theorems or the main topics are clearly emphasized in these notes). So I am learning most of the material outside of class. But then there is also clearly something wrong with how I'm learning. \n\nI usually go about targeting my studying for the midterm 2-3 weeks before the midterm. I do as many of the assignment problems as I can, but most of my focus is on defining the information in a holistic way, so that I can see the bigger picture. But again, a lot of that initial time is spent actually learning the material on my own. I make summary sheets and do examples from multiple resources. I look back to the beginning of my notes constantly, I go through his lecture slides online. I am studying an hour or more each day, and about a week before the midterms I usually study 4+ hours. This course has taken so much time away from my other courses, and I am definitely worried about how it is impacting my grades there. In addition, I am feeling almost constant stress daily. I have tension headaches and anxiety attacks. It is exhausting, especially because I know there are things I could do to improve my studying, it's just that I don't have the mental resources to do them all without breaking down. It gets to the point where I forget to shower, I forget to eat. When I do feel like I should take a break I feel like I'm wasting time. It's always nagging at me, and I feel so guilty for not doing everything I could do to do well. \n\nHowever, I enjoy my studying most of the time, I have fun doing math. This is a subject I feel passionate about inherently. I went into the most recent midterm feeling confident as well. I knew I didn't have about 10% of the material \"automatic\", but I thought that 90% would carry me and that I'd do well. But now I'm feeling quite dejected. My study habits are definitely improving, but I don't see the pay-off. I feel more confident in my mathematics ability compared to previous years, but it is not showing in my grades. \n\nI don't know what to do, and I really need some advice. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.

An idea for a hobby project I have had on my mind for a while, but never had the time to act on, is a weekly YouTube series covering selected key papers (for example following the historical accounts of Dieudonn\u00e9 of algebraic geometry and of algebraic and differential topology).\n\nI have not given much thought to concrete aspects of the format, but presumably I would place the papers in their historical context and expound on the main ideas and how they advanced the field. I estimate that an average video might be around 60-90 minutes long and flow like a newspaper article - main ideas and high level discussion followed by elaborations on details. This would be followed up with a Q&A video addressing viewer questions. This loose format has been successful at the journal clubs at my university.\n\nWould you, or do know if people around you would be interested in this kind of content? Of course, interest may vary depending on the subfield covered. I also welcome feedback and advice on any aspect of the project.\n\nThis post is mainly to gauge interest. Depending on feedback, I may try to carry it out later this year.",

The person presenting his work then crossed out \"trivially\" and wrote instead \"indubitably.\" This inspired me to write a program that will insert condescending adverbial phrases before any statement in a math proof. Below is the list--please come up with more if you can!\n\nObviously  \nClearly  \nAnyone can see that  \nTrivially  \nIndubitably  \nIt follows that  \nEvidently  \nBy basic applications of previously proven lemmas,  \nThe proof is left to the reader that  \nIt goes without saying that  \nConsequently  \nBy immediate consequence,  \nOf course  \nBut then again  \nBy symmetry  \nWithout loss of generality,  \nAnyone with a fifth grade education can see that  \nI would wager 5 dollars that  \nBy the contrapositive  \nWe need not waste ink in proving that  \nBy Euler  \nBy Fermat  \nBy a simple diagonalization argument,  \nWe all agree that  \nIt would be absurd to deny that  \nUnquestionably,  \nIndisputably,  \nIt is plain to see that  \nIt would be embarrassing to miss the fact that   \nIt would be an insult to my time and yours to prove that   \nAny cretin with half a brain could see that  \nBy Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem,  \nBy the Axiom of Choice,  \nIt is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis that  \nBy a simple counting argument,  \nSimply put,  \nOne\u2019s mind immediately leaps to the conclusion that  \nBy contradiction,  \nI shudder to think of the poor soul who denies that  \nIt is readily apparent to the casual observer that  \nWith p < 5% we conclude that  \nIt follows from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms that  \nSet theory tells us that  \nDivine inspiration reveals to us that   \nPatently,  \nNeedless to say,   \nBy logic  \nBy the Laws of Mathematics  \nBy all means,  \nWith probability 1,   \nWho could deny that   \nAssuming the Continuum Hypothesis,   \nGalois died in order to show us that  \nThere is a marvellous proof (which is too long to write here) that   \nWe proved in class that  \nOur friends over at Harvard recently discovered that   \nIt is straightforward to show that  \nBy definition,  \nBy a simple assumption,   \nIt is easy to see that  \nEven you would be able to see that   \nEverybody knows that   \nI don\u2019t know why anybody would ask, but   \nBetween you and me,   \nUnless you accept G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem,   \nA reliable source has told me  \nIt is a matter of simple arithmetic to show that  \nBeyond a shadow of a doubt,  \nWhen we view this problem as an undecidable residue class whose elements are universal DAGs, we see that   \nYou and I both know that   \nAnd there you have it,  \nAnd as easy as ABC,   \nAnd then as quick as a wink,   \nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention you\u2019d realize that  \nBy the Pigeonhole Principle  \nBy circular reasoning we see that  \nWhen we make the necessary and sufficient assumptions,   \nIt is beyond the scope of this course to prove that   \nOnly idealogues and sycophants would debate whether   \nIt is an unfortunately common misconception to doubt that   \nBy petitio principii, we assert that   \nWe may take for granted that   \nFor legal reasons I am required to disclose that   \nIt is elementary to show that   \nI don\u2019t remember why, but you\u2019ll have to trust me that   \nFollowing the logical steps, we might conclude  \nWe are all but forced to see that   \nBy the same logic,   \nI\u2019m not even going to bother to prove that   \nBy Kant\u2019s Categorical imperative,   \nEveryone and their mother can see that  \nA child could tell you that  \nIt baffles me that you haven\u2019t already realized that   \nNotice then that  \nJust this once I will admit to you that  \nUsing the proper mindset one sees that  \nRemember the basic laws of common sense:  \nThere is a lovely little argument that shows that   \nFigure 2 (not shown here) makes it clear that   \nAlas, would that it were not true that   \nIf I\u2019m being honest with you,   \nAccording to the pointy-headed theorists sitting in their Ivory Towers in academia,  \nWe will take as an axiom that  \nAccept for the moment that   \nThese are your words, not mine, but  \nA little birdie told me that  \nI heard through the grapevine that   \nIn the realm of constructive mathematics,   \nIt is a theorem from classical analysis that  \nLife is too short to prove that  \nA consequence of IUT is that  \nAs practitioners are generally aware,  \nIt is commonly understood that  \nAs the reader is no doubt cognizant,  \nAs an exercise for the reader, show that  \nAll the cool kids know that  \nIt is not difficult to see that  \nTerry Tao told me in a

leads us to the conclusion that  \nWhich is to say  \nThat is,  \nThe force of deductive logic then drives one to the conclusion that  \nWhereafter we find  \nAssuming the reader\u2019s intellect approaches that of the writer, it should be obvious that  \nErgo  \nWith God as my witness,  \nAs a great man once told me,  \nOne would be hard-pressed to disprove that  \nEven an applied mathematician would concede that  \nOne sees in a trice that  \nYou can convince yourself that  \nMama always told me    \nI know it, you know it, everybody knows that  \nEven the most incompetent T.A. could see,  \nThis won't be on the test, but  \nTake it from me,  \nAxiomatically,  \nNaturally,  \nA cursory glance reveals that  \nAs luck would have it,  \nThrough the careful use of common sense,  \nBy the standard argument,  \nI hope I don\u2019t need to explain that  \nAccording to prophecy,  \nOnly a fool would deny that  \nIt is almost obvious that  \nBy method of thinking,  \nThrough sheer force of will,  \nIntuitively,  \nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you that  \nYou of all people should realize that  \nThe Math Gods demand that  \nThe clever student will notice  \nAn astute reader will have noticed that  \nIt was once revealed to me in a dream that  \nEven my grandma knows that  \nUnless something is horribly wrong,  \nAnd now we have all we need to show that  \nIf you use math, you can see that  \nIt holds vacuously that  \nNow check this out:  \nBarring causality breakdown, clearly  \nWe don't want to deprive the reader of the joy of discovering for themselves why  \nOne of the Bernoullis probably showed that  \nSomebody once told me  \nBy extrapolation,  \nCategorically,  \nIf the reader is sufficiently alert, they will notice that  \nIt\u2019s hard not to prove that  \nThe sophisticated reader will realize that  \nIn this context,  \nIt was Lebesque who first asked whether  \nAs is tradition,  \nAccording to local folklore,  \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident that  \nBy simple induction,  \nIn case you weren\u2019t paying attention,  \nA poor student or a particularly clever dog will realize immediately that  \nEvery student brought up in the American education system is told that  \nMost experts agree that  \nSober readers see that  \nAnd would you look at that:  \nAnd lo!  \nBy abstract nonsense,  \nI leave the proof to the suspicious reader that  \nWhen one stares at the equations they immediately rearrange themselves to show that  \nThis behooves you to state that  \nTherefore  \nThe heralds shall sing for generations hence that  \nIf I\u2019ve said it once I\u2019ve said it a thousand times,  \nOur forefathers built this country on the proposition that  \nMy father told me, and his father before that, and his before that, that  \nAs sure as the sun will rise again tomorrow morning,  \nThe burden of proof is on my opponents to disprove that  \nIf you ask me,  \nI didn\u2019t think I would have to spell this out, but  \nFor all we know,  \nPromise me you won\u2019t tell mom, but  \nIt would be a disservice to human intelligence to deny that  \nProof of the following has

hatred of 10,000 years ensures that  \nThere isn\u2019t enough space in the footnote section to prove that  \nSimple deduction from peano\u2019s axioms shows  \nBy a careful change of basis we see that  \nUsing Conway\u2019s notation we see that  \nThe TL;DR is that  \nCertainly,  \nSurely  \nAn early theorem of Gauss shows that  \nAn English major could deduce that  \nAnd Jesus said to his

Hello everybody.\n\nThe mathematician and algebraic geometer Alexander Kuznetsov (Steklov & HSE) has been arrested yesterday - together with his daughter -  for peacefully protesting the detention of Alexey Navalny.\n\nSasha Kuznetsov is one of the most influential algebraic geometers in the world. Also, is one of the kindest and nicest people to interact with.\n\nRichard Thomas (Professor at Imperial College) has started a petition asking for his release. You can find the petition here: [https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/free-alexander-kuznetsov](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/free-alexander-kuznetsov)\n\nPlease consider to signing it and share the news.\n\nEDIT:\n\n* An update from the petition's website: \"Sasha's trial has been postponed until Wednesday; he has been released until then. His daughter has been released with a fine. Please continue to sign to express solidarity with all the mathematics students and members of the public who are also detained.\"\n* Update: another petition has been started asking for the release of the other maths students arrested.

    "postText": "In memory of a brilliant math teacher  \n\nHello, everyone. I found out last night that my high school math teacher, whom I had for Pre-Calculus and AP Calculus BC, was killed yesterday in a tragic accident. I won\u2019t go into too many details to preserve his privacy, but I would like to share what he meant to me and my math journey.\n\nAs a child, I was \u2018bad at math.\u2019 I\u2019m not sure where that began, but by the time I was in middle school, being bad at math was part of my identity. I was the butt of many jokes because I couldn\u2019t add fractions or draw a graph. I hated math with a passion and often didn\u2019t do my homework out of spite. I passed, but only because I was desperate to be done with math as soon as possible.\n\nMy high school required Pre-Calculus for graduation, so I stumbled in there in 11th grade with the expectation that it would be painful, but my last mathematical punishment. This particular math teacher taught my class the second semester. He brought a new approach, focused not on lecture and formula memorization but on derivations, proofs, and problem solving. He talked about \u2018intuition,\u2019 which I had never thought would apply to math.\n\nSomething about his manner and style made me care. I liked him as a person, so I wanted him to see me try. I stayed after class one day to ask about a problem I\u2019d gotten wrong on a problem set, and we ended up filling the wall-to-wall whiteboards for 3 hours after the school day ended. We drifted from limits to derivatives to Newton\u2019s laws and the origins of calculus, and somehow, *I followed along.* For the first time in my life, I saw math and was *excited.*\n\nStaying after class, or through the lunch hour, or arriving early in the morning became routine for me. I loved it. My grades shot from passing marks to consistent As. I looked forward to Pre-Calc all day. By the end of that single semester, I went from not understanding the unit circle to being confident doing derivatives. When I found out that this teacher was teaching AP Calc BC the next year, I rearranged my entire class schedule away from the humanities towards STEM classes. My education finally excited me.\n\nHe wrote my recommendation letter when I applied to college, and I got into a great school where I\u2019m now pursuing a physics and economics double-major with plans to go for a PhD. in physics after I graduate. Without him, I never would have found the fields that I love and I never would have stopped doubting my intelligence. He believed in and supported me when I didn\u2019t think I deserved it, and altered the course of my education and career for the better. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful.\n\nThank you for reading such a long post. I want to celebrate a fantastic teacher who died far too soon. To all math teachers dedicated to their students: you are invaluable and can truly change lives. I regret not being able to tell my math teacher how much I appreciate his work. He taught me so much about math and beyond, and I don\u2019t know how to honour him properly.",

Whenever I talk to people about mathematics, it seems like everyone feels absolutely hopeless. Despite the success of channels like Numberphile and 3blue1brown, there's still a prevailing attitude of \"well, that kid I saw on TV the other day can do advanced calculus on the fly, why should I even bother looking into something I'm clearly never going to be good at\". The more I think about it, the sadder it is, because mathematics is arguably the most powerful tool in existence. Seeing it subjugated to this ruthlessly competitive framework (should be noted, I'm talking about primary to high school level math here, once you get into academia, competition is obviously vital). Sort of echoing Lockhart's famous essay here, but imagine if we discouraged people from creating music, experimenting with completely new sounds and ideas, finding totally ways of simplifying complicated ideas, and decided that everyone (even potentially) interested in music has to endure a grueling process akin to the movie \"Whiplash\". I'm sorry if this post came across as incoherent rambling, it's just such a shame that mathematics still struggles with this image of being relegated to the select few, while everyone else shouldn't even try to discover its hidden beauty.",

I can't express enough how much math-phobia kept me from fulfilling my potential and doing what I wanted to do. Now at 28 years old I made a 93 on the final exam and my final grade for college algebra class will be an A. I took this class 4 times in a row years ago and failed it every time. I know some of you were probably acing college algebra at age 14, but accomplishing this is quite life changing for me. It proves to myself that I can do whatever I set out to do If I put in the work. I told myself \"I'm not stupid, I'm not bad at math, I just need to rebuild my foundation\". So that's what I did, I went back as far as basic multiplication. Fractions. Etc. I did all this before the semester even started. I didn't skip anything I didn't understand. Now I can say something I thought I would never say: math is cool and fun, I like it and I want to do more of it.\n\nI'm living proof that if MY dumb ass can turn it around, anyone can. I know it will get  a lot harder from here, but I'm a different person now and am confident in my foundation this time.

This next meeting is going to happen in Saint Petersburg, Russia in 2022.\n\nRight now, mathematicians are [boycotting ICM](http://www.icm2022boycott.org/) in Russia due to the government's treatment of its political prisoners.\n\nOne of the most outrageous cases is that [of Azat Miftakhov](http://miftakhov.org/), a PhD student at Moscow State University. He has been under arrest for almost two years without any reason. He was tortured, sexually assaulted (with a screwdriver), and his family was threatened. Russian civil right society Memorial recognizes him as a political prisoner due to his anarchist views.\n\nHe is a dedicated mathematician -- he published [two](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07680.pdf) (!) [papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04962.pdf) while being in the detention center with no access to Internet or scientific literature in English.\n\nThe statements in support of Azat were released by the [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France](https://smf.emath.fr/actualites-smf/141120-azat-miftakhov-toujours-emprisonne-en-russie) and by the [American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/policy-statements/miftakhov) in which mathematicians demanded a fair and transparent trial for Azat.\n\nRight now there is huge action happening. Hundreds of mathematicians and other academics (including Terry Tao, Victor Kac, Richard Stanley etc) sign the open letter in support of Azat because his is going on trial before the end of the year. I urge you to join and sign the letter as well. It really can make a difference.\n\n[http://miftakhov.org/sign/eng](http://miftakhov.org/sign/eng)\n\nMany mathematicians ask a question: how can Russia host the ICM in 2022 when, inside the country, Russian mathematicians are tortured in prisons with no fair trials or proof of crime?",

    "postText": "My analysis professor was a PhD student of Terrance Tao\u2019s. It was horrendous. Just a funny story that happened a while back. I am an aerospace engineering student getting a minor in math. I might switch to a double major, so I took analysis to cover that basis just in case. Little did I know I signed up for the hardest possible analysis course for an undergraduate student to take at my university, taught by Shuanglin Shao. On the first day of class he was using shorthand I wasn\u2019t familiar with and was also not talking while he wrote. He just wrote without speaking (straight from memory, no textbook or notes, as most math professors in my experience seem to do). \n\nThere were only about 8 people in this class. We started with 14, then got to metric spaces and went down to 8. The first homework assignment happened and I got a 60%. I felt defeated as I had tried so hard. Then I looked at the class average and it was a 40%. Felt better. Well that was the best I did on a homework assignment all semester. Good thing was that if you just went to his office hours he just gave you a 60% on your homework automatically. \n\nAbout his office hours. He is one of those very disorganized whiteboard users. He has all of his research on the whiteboard and he tells you to just pick a spot in between the harmonic series\u2019 or whatever the hell he was working on. He also preferred to talk more about Chinese proverbs and culture than to actually help you with math. \n\nMe: \u201cSo I don\u2019t really understand this idea of open ball\u2026\u201d \n\nShao: \u201cyou know math is kind of like a cockroach\u201d \n\nI once received extra credit in his class for sending him a receipt from one of his favorite restaurants that he wanted us to try. \n\nAnywho, then came the first exam. I came out of there feeling like I rocked it. Of the 10 questions, there was only 1 that I was kind of unsure on. Well I got a 20% on that exam. When I went to ask him about what I did wrong he said \u201cyou have the right idea for all of these, but you didn\u2019t quite say it right. And there is no partial credits\u201d. So that was fantastic. I then had a zoom meeting with him to discuss if I should drop the class because as it stood I would not be able to pass the class even with a 100% on the final that was worth 50% of my grade. He calmly reassured me to not drop the class as 50% of the class would get an A, and the others would get a B. \n\nAs the semester went on, with my new found knowledge that I could not fail the class I started to have fun. I realized that he was a super nice guy that loves to learn about my culture, and teach others about his. I learned to laugh at his small antics in class that were previously frustrating, and by the end of the semester I had made 8 new friends (one being a 15 year old that was somehow in this class and had an uncurved 98%). During the final, I brought an Arnold Palmer (half iced tea, half lemonade) and offered it to him and he asked if it was beer and was sad when I told him no. In the end, I probably finished with like a 40% in the class, but he gave me an A. \n\nSorry this is really random, but I just felt like sharing one of my favorite college memories with the smartest professor I have ever taken a class under.",

I have no connection to this university but I think I should not initiate misunderstanding.\n\nHere are some open letters written by affected faculties in University of Leicester, sent to Vice-Chancellor. \n\n* [Medieval Literature and the University of Leicester](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZksZuLqKYu0tETr8T61rEJ3WbtG8R7HVadOBjUQnDqw/edit)\n* [Public Letter to the University of Leicester Concerning the Proposed Redundancies in the School of Business, January 26, 2021 ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6LKASpFkpwidMcqFrNl_dKzI07as4ZbtOQAiuJWpSlWwNIA/viewform)\n* [Department of Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour Petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvaMsSXoOrqPDLkoNp47NZYh59alZcHJoKEuIi17Ua_hEHMw/viewform)\n\n[Dr Emma Battell Lowman](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/history/people/staff-pages/dr-emma-battell-lowman/dr-emma-battell-lowman) described what happened at the beginning: It's the first day of semester 2 undergrad teaching at Leicester, and many @uniofleicester staff have just received notification by email their jobs are at risk due to major & imminent cuts.

This is a second course in linear algebra, intended to be taken after you've already learned about standard matrix thingies like solving linear systems, determinants, and eigenvalues. The final video (i.e., lecture 41) is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QkKcEQQ38g, and the full playlist is available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOAf1ViVP13jdhvy-wVS7aR02xnDxueuL\n\nFeedback very welcome! I'll be making a series of videos for a first course in linear algebra next, and I'd like to get things as ironed out as possible before then. (You'll notice that the video and sound quality in lecture 41 are both much better than in lecture 1 -- I'm learning as I go!)",

    "postTitle": "Debunking a minor mathematical myth",
    "postText": "Debunking a minor mathematical myth While scrolling through /r/all yesterday, I came upon [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/3gmz9w/futurama_hidden_jokes_and_secrets/) from /r/futurama. The linked album reveals the following 'hidden secret' from Season 9 Episode 9, 'Free Will Hunting', accompanied by [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/tGp8Mhw.png): \n\n\"10011101 = 157, the largest known number with a square that is an anagram to the square of the next integer (158)\"\n\nWhile the Futurama writers are known to be mathemtically inclined, this got my Spidey-senses tingling. I consulted the most reliable source at hand, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/157_(number\\)), which reiterates:\n\n\"In base 10, 157^2 is 24649, and 158^2 is 24964, which uses the same digits. 157 is the largest known number with a square that relates in this way to the square of the next integer.\"\n\nI was still skeptical, since this really doesn't seem like a very difficult property to satisfy. So I coded up a very quick Python script and set it up to run on my machine overnight:\n\n    import collections\n    curr = 0\n    while True:\n        if collections.Counter(str(curr**2)) == collections.Counter(str((curr+1)**2)):\n            print curr\n        curr+= 1\n\t\t\n(collections.Counter objects are [multisets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset))\n\nTo my surprise, the program started spouting off hits immediately:\n\n    13\n    157\n    913\n    4513\n    14647\n    ...\n\nIt's no error. 913^2 = 833569 and 914^2 = 835396, which are anagrams. I thought maybe the fact was supposed to be that 157 is the largest known *prime* number with this property, but 4513 is prime too, and 4513^2 = 20367169 and 4514^2 = 20376196.\n\nGoing back to Wikipedia, this factoid (noun: an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print [[1\\]](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/factoid)) was actually the first substantive content added to the page for 157 way back in [November 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=157_(number\\)&oldid=11515328) by one 'Anton Mravcek'. It now appears in Futurama-related contexts like [this Buzzfeed list](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikesilv/29-hidden-futurama-jokes-secrets-1nbmy#.mxpM6GjK1) and [IMDB trivia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005623/trivia), but has also made its way into some unrelated pages like [this list](http://www.archimedes-lab.org/numbers/Num70_200.html) of 'What's Special About This Number?' and probably others with even more different wordings.\n\nI'll edit the Wikipedia page later and remove this factoid, and try to contact the other websites about removing their incorrect statements. Since the same list of Futurama 'secrets' is undoubtedly going to continue to be shared, hopefully anyone skeptical enough to Google that secret will find this page disproving it.\n\nTL;DR: [OEIS A072841](https://oeis.org/A072841) does not end with the second entry.",

    "postText": "My paper is now a section of a textbook! A couple of years ago, I wrote a [paper](https://ncr.mae.ufl.edu/papers/JMAA18.pdf) on a  reproducing kernel Hilbert space that my co-authors and I came up with, called the Mittag-Leffler Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space of Entire Function. It gave a one parameter generalization of the Fock space, and like how the Fock space connects the densely defined operators of multiplication by z and differentiation through an adjoint relation, our space connected fractional differentiation and multiplication by z\\^q (for q real).\n\nIt is a nice clean result, and since then I have worked with various authors extending some properties of the space, where last year (or two years ago?) I published a [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11785-020-01064-5) with Pham Viet Hai characterizing bounded and compact weighted composition operators over that space (for q between 0 and 2). Occasionally, I take a stab at another property here and there, but I've mostly moved on to newer work.\n\nThen the other day, my colleague Benjamin Russo texted me, and told me that our paper is actually an entire section on a [new edition of a standard work](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-61550-8) about Mittag-Leffler functions! I was floored. Both by the idea that the authors actually read my work, but that they felt that this work should be alongside a lot of classical theorems about the Mittag-Leffler function.\n\nIt's nice to be validated through publications, but this is definitely a step up.\n\nMade my day :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Section 3.6.3 is my work!](https://preview.redd.it/b3mfz0l3nnb81.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=650467a71c45a21e789081d8498952a05e86478c)",

    "postText": "A big thank you to this subreddit I\u2019m from a super underprivileged high school in America where no one really studies anything, much less a girl studying math. Most of the math teachers at my school don\u2019t even know how to solve the problems they give to students! However, in freshman year, I read my math 1 textbook and found it very interesting. I then just searched up \u201cmath\u201d on reddit and found you guys! All the amazing posts made me even more interested in math. Then, I went to the list of free math learning resources you guys have, which is where I found Khan Academy (I know Khan Academy is super common in other places but no one knows of it in my town). I discovered that list in the middle of freshman year. So in my second semester of freshman year, I went through all of lower level math courses, Calculus AB/BC, and Statistics. Since then, I have been using that list to help me learn more math. I have used all the resources on your list and they are all really useful (Khan Academy taught me how to apply to colleges!). This subreddit has helped me grow a passion for math and education when I didn\u2019t have the support or resources myself. This year, I am a graduating senior. I have applied to many colleges and have already been accepted to ucla, ucsb, uci early for their various honors things. Thank you so much for providing a place for me to foster passion and knowledge! I\u2019m so excited for what the future holds for me in math :)",

    "postText": "The Common Core is corrupting school mathematics with \"modern\" methods that don't make sense. As a professional mathematician, I am seriously concerned about the way in which the Common Core Standards are distorting and corrupting the mathematics students learn in school.  In short, the Common Core introduces newfangled methods for doing mathematics that contain unnecessary or inexplicable steps and are vastly inferior to the methods we have been using for hundreds of years.\n\nTake, for example, this multiplication problem:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/0TDJAcR\n\nThe new Common Core way of doing this problem is a mess; it throws in random digits (called \"partial products\") and haphazardly omits digits from positions based on a mysterious pseudoscientific principle the Reform Math beatniks call \"place value.\"  The Common Core calls this the \"standard algorithm,\" probably alluding to federal efforts to standardize the school curriculum and the way we teach our kids.\n\nIf you think that's an embarrassment, look at what the Common Core has done to division:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/sQTq0tH\n\nFor hundreds of years we've used the old reliable method of dividing whole numbers by moving from left to right, and sometimes up and down, to record calculations while also crossing out old ones.  This method gives you everything you want from an algorithm: at each stage it is obvious what to do next; it's efficient from start to finish; and it clearly records your work so that you or your friend can verify the steps.  Now, the Common Core-industrial complex is forcing students to meander aimlessly through this \"long division algorithm\" that produces a cascade of digits and symbols (like the upside-down L and the hyphens) that don't follow any rules or reason.\n\nIf you think the Common Core has made a mockery of elementary mathematics, wait till you see what they've done with high school algebra:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/cYBLWpZ\n\nIt used to be that you could just solve a quadratic equation using an obvious u-substitution to split the difference, rearrange the resulting difference of squares, and follow the cases to get the solutions, and everybody minded their own business.  But the busybodies behind the Common Core are insisting that students use a dadaistic \"quadratic formula.\"  In case you haven't met this horrific creation yet, it transforms a single equation in one variable into a single equation in four variables (x, a, b, c), with some of the variables later taking on variables that, one can only surmise, are assigned arbitrarily.  Note that even if you don't mind the tortured mess this method creates, it's hard to escape the fact that *it doesn't even produce the correct answer.*\n\nEven as it makes math more difficult for children from elementary to high school, the Common Core is imposing low expectations on our students.  Consider this problem involving addition of fractions:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/yshMI\n\nStudents used to be expected to go through an organized process of finding the least common denominator, converting both addends so that they have that common denominator, adding the numerators, and then reducing the resulting fraction to lowest terms.  This was a simple, straightforward process that required only basic fraction sense, understanding of whole-number addition, and a first-semester course in undergraduate number theory.  Now, the Common Core is saying it's okay not to worry about least common denominators; and if your answer isn't reduced, well, to-may-to / to-mah-to.  The Common Core is introducing all of this \"problem solving\" that relies on sudden insight and creative thinking and getting math away from what children should be doing: learning to operate on numbers according to pre-specified routines and instructions to produce a simple numerical output - you know, the sort of work that will position our kids for jobs that will exist well into the 21st century.\n\nThe Common Core Standards are throwing out a lot of what was great about mathematics - the focus on computation, the strict adherence to rigid procedures, the focus on the one right answer - and bowing to the new gods of \"conceptual understanding,\" \"algebraic thinking,\" and \"problem solving.\"  I urge you to join me in resisting this race to the bottom.\n\nTL;DR: The Common Core is taking mathematics that has worked perfectly well for hundreds of years and turning it into an unintelligible mess.  We must think of what this is doing to our children.  Album containing all of these convoluted math methods: http://imgur.com/a/kE6Ws",

[This picture](http://imgur.com/N10ESfl) of a mug and the reflection of its saucer got me wondering: Is there a cup shape that would make this illusion work from any angle?\n\nI think I have found a solution (If you know some things about conic sections you may be able to come up with the solution as well):\n\nThe cup would be a hyperboloid (of one sheet) and the rim of the saucer would be locus of the focal points of the hyperbolas on its surface.\n\nI've thought this through for the \"two dimensional\" (hyperbola) case and would think it would also work in three dimensions. If people are interested I can provide the explanation for the \"two dimensional\" case. The proof for 3 dimensions would probably be quite challenging, but maybe someone here is up to the task?\n\nEdit: I've created a [visualization in Blender](http://imgur.com/hhPLCAD) and it seems to be in line with my hypothesis.\n\nEdit 2: [Visualization of the 2D version](http://imgur.com/kWKxKn5): The reflection of F1 coincides with the actual image of F2 (eye is in the top right corner). The equality of the two angles is a property of a hyperbola.\n\nEdit 3: Wow, thanks for the upvotes and the nice comments! Now I'm motivated to find a general proof for the 3d version. Will keep you updated if I get any results.\n\nEdit 4: This is getting way more attention than I anticipated. I'll definitely try my best to find a proof and share it with you, although this may take some days or even longer. Also, thanks for the gold!\n\nEdit 5 (two days later): I've created an [interactive visualization in GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/m/zzUXN6Cf) ([static version](http://imgur.com/ZxMqbZ1)) that **strongly** suggests this works in the 3d version as well. Also, I'm pretty confident I can deliver a proof today! Stay tuned!\n\nEdit 6 (four days later): I've finally created a [write-up that includes a proof](http://karuga.eu/transparent-cup.html) ([corresponding reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/4tnz48/update_on_the_transparent_cup_includes_proof/))",

    "postText": "I think pop culture portrays math as being really hard and it sets learners up for failure before they even start learning it I was having a conversation with a few teacher friends about teaching math in early education, and it got me thinking. In popular culture, I feel like advanced math is portrayed as something that is extremely difficult to do and you need to be a savant to even attempt it. Over and over again I hear comments on TV and in movies complaining about \"when they put letters in math\" blah blah . I think that this dissuades young students from even trying to learn math. Because of the way it's presented in popular culture, young students think they're going to hate it and don't even try, teachers seem to favor the kids who \"get it\" and ignore the others, which just discourages them further. Once they fall behind, they stay behind and internalize the notion that they just \"aren't good at math\", and don't even try. 90% of people I talk to think they're not good at math, but somehow I doubt that 90% of people can be below average at it. \n\nI think this attitude and portrayal in pop culture sucks. I really think that if math was portrayed the same way as any other academic subject, students might be more open minded to it, might discover they like it, might get into it and even someday advance the field.

So it's a nice way to produce \"e\", and also perhaps a simple way to investigate the randomness of primes. Like others have said, it would have been more interesting if the prime example didn't converge to \"e\", because that would diverge from random numbers, providing interest in the primes' distribution. One thing I notice is that the random list has two rows five long, while the prime list has none. Also of interest would be to investigate if the primes take longer to converge to \"e\" than the randoms. It would be nice to get more info on these aspects.

I love it because this pattern is a fundamental pattern of the universe - as TetraspaceWest put it: it's a \"platonic structure of mathematics visible in all possible worlds\".   \nBut unlike most platonic structures in mathematics, it is deeply, (some might say unsettlingly) lacking in symmetry. Not sure if that seems surprising because we \\*focus more\\* on 'beautiful' maths, or because most of maths genuinely has a bias towards symmetry. Even things governed by chaotic dynamics tend to have a lot more patterns within them than this.  \n\n\nI really would like to see more examples of this kind of asymmetric disorder in mathematics. Let me know  if you have any.  \n\n\nCredit to the tweet that allowed me to stumble on this beauty:  \n[https://twitter.com/TetraspaceWest/status/1625135712726052864](https://twitter.com/TetraspaceWest/status/1625135712726052864)",

Math can be hard, don\u2019t get me wrong. But, in elementary school/primary school we learn from siblings and older friends that math sucks and that it\u2019s so hard and that loads of them around us \u201cjust aren\u2019t math people\u201d. \n\nWell, give a kid a hard math assignment, and when he or she gets stuck on a tough problem, they\u2019ve got two options.\n\n1) Realize that a hard problem is a hard problem and requires more personal effort\n\nOR\n\n2) Think \u201cWell, just like (friend/sibling/peer), I\u2019m just not that good at math, so it doesn\u2019t matter how long I work at this problem, I just won\u2019t get it\u201d.\n\nFor an elementary age kid, it\u2019s especially tempting to choose the second option. \n\nWe grow up watching older students and siblings and friends talk about how struggling with math is \u201cjust how they are\u201d and then, the first time we run into a tough problem, follow their lead and blame it on some innate personality trait. Oh, I\u2019m just not a MATH person. Just like somebody would say, oh, I\u2019m a cat or a dog person. \n\nWe see our peers 100% in belief of the fact that you might just inevitably suck at math regardless of personal effort, and that really hard math problem might convince a kid that maybe he falls into that category too, when in reality, it\u2019s just a tough problem. \n\nSo we then internalize that there\u2019s just no point even trying, it\u2019s better to accept our fate as inevitably bad at math, because well, hey, isn\u2019t everybody?\n\nTook me till college to realize that I was shooting myself in the foot by telling myself I just wasn\u2019t smart enough for STEM, when I know I am, with the major and grades to prove it now.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to unlearn a personality trait you falsely assign yourself at a young age, but I genuinely think there are a ton of capable young kids out there who are giving up before they even get started. \n\n\n(obviously doesn\u2019t include ppl who are GENUINELY shite at math, they exist, just not in the quantity I think people have convinced themselves of)\n\nIf this topic is commonly covered I apologize.\n\n\nedit: words\n\nedit 2: thanks for the gold what do i do with it",

I once again tried to come back to /r/math to participate, and I once again am running into the same problem: almost every time an interesting conversation comes up, and I try to contribute, a moderator comes along and removes the thread.  I am not quite ready to go away again, so I'm raising this question to see if I can get more input.\n\nAre there are actually people here who believe it helps to have moderators coming in and labeling people's discussions as too simple to be worthy? Personally, I find it infuriating when I take the time to engage with someone, only to be told the conversation wasn't good enough.  I cannot even imagine what it must feel like to the person who started the discussion in the first place!\n\nI suppose a few examples are worthwhile.\n\n* This morning, it was [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/sjn5es/does_a_simplex_have_to_be_triangular/) comparing the definitions of a simplex and a hyperplane and asking about the relationship.  As someone who wasn't the OP, I still learned some things in the first few comments, and thought about ideas in a different way.  But too bad for anyone who was a bit slower to engage, because the question was gone a few minutes later, the victim of a moderator who felt the question was so simple that people *shouldn't* have been interested in it.\n* A couple weeks ago, it was [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/s94dhp/i_found_a_weird_pattern_with_fibonacci_numbers/) that posed an interesting puzzle about Fibonacci numbers.  So interesting that I not only engaged in the thread, but posted a link to Twitter because I felt investigating the question was a cool experience I wanted to share with others.  Apparently, some moderator disagreed, though, because within minutes I had people on Twitter asking me what it was about since a moderator removed the thread and they couldn't read the post.\n\n(For those who didn't catch these early, I'm sorry you can't read the actual post.  This is part of the problem!  As soon as a moderator decides to shut these discussions down, the often somewhat detailed and interesting post is immediately lost.)\n\nNote: I'm **not** talking about spam.  I'm **not** talking about people posting homework questions or asking for specific calculations.  I am talking about genuine interesting discussion of mathematics that's often even at least at an advanced undergraduate level.  I have to clarify this, because when I've tried to raise the issue before, it's been met with deflection to talk about spam or homework problems.\n\nIn the past, the rules were reworded about this, to say \"Questions should spark discussion\".  That sounds great, and yet I'm continually seeing questions that spark discussion being shut down.  It's like the rules changed, but the moderation didn't.",

When I\u2019m teaching an upper division undergraduate or a graduate course in mathematics, well, I don\u2019t know everything. Sometimes there are problems that have eluded me since undergrad or I might be teaching a class I never formally took while in school. And sometimes, I will throw one of those problems into my homework assignments. Most of the motivation is to force myself to give the problem some serious thought, and other times, I just want to see how my students approach a problem that is especially difficult.\n\nAll but once, I\u2019ve been able to actually solve the problem before it came up, and I don\u2019t grade those particular problems very harshly. Usually, I give points to those who at least gave it a shot, and more points when they actually tried something that was somewhat credible.\n\nAm I the only one that does this? It does add a bit of a thrill back to a subject, where I know I will face a bunch of grumpy students, if I can\u2019t solve it.",

    "postText": "[Shitpost] Who is the greatest mathematician of all time This is obviously pretty subjective. But I still want to make a shit post about math because it seems fun. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have created a system to rank each mathematician by the following criteria ranked out of 10: Applicability/importance of their contributions, how distinguished they are, and how wild their life was (obstensibly). You may be asking about the last one, and that one is because mathematicians are more than just their math or something I dont know I couldnt think of anything else. Then I'll find the mean of each of these criteria to get a final rating. I'll go in chronological order starting with Pythagoras.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pythagoras:**\n\na\\^2 + b\\^2 = c\\^2. That is about all this guy did mathematically other than worship triangular numbers and fucking drown Hippasus for proving the existence of irrational numbers (maybe). Nonetheless, this theorem is used by millions of people daily including lost trigonometry and geometry high school students, right triangle lovers, and architects I bet. I just hope all of the above dont attempt to solve a right triangle with both legs equaling 1 in case Pythagoras comes back to life with a vendetta. But guess the fuck what? The Babylonians AND the Egyptians both knew this shit hundreds of years before he figured it out, and we give him credit? Fuck no Joe, thats a double copy. So, I give him a mathematical applicability/importance rating of \\[0\\] and a distinguish rating of \\[0\\]. Now onto his life. Many Greeks considered Pythagoras to be a mystic. He starting a fucking NUMBER CULT in which you would apparently have to swear to five years of silence to be initiated. Now THATS quality cult leading. He also apparently had a thigh made of pure gold. Whether that last one is true or not, I give his life a perfect \\[10\\]. This gives Pythagoras a total rating of \\[3.333....\\]. Bet he fucking hates that number. Fuck you Pythagoras try to drown me I dare you copier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Euclid:**\n\nI would absolutely love to see a brawl between Euclid and Riemann over geometry, they could fight in the octagon (sorry). But sadly he was born thousands of years before that. Euclid's axioms are vital in all aspects of geometry and they have held up for thousands of years. Not gonna lie though, I probably could have at least come up with the first one in Kindergarten. And maybe even the 7th one in 4th grade. And maybe the last one fresh out of the womb. But that's beside the point. His axioms and theorems were the foundations for so many aspects of mathematics for thousands of years. Nice work Euclid. For that I give him a contribution rating of a perfect \\[10\\]. For his distinguish rating, I'm gonna argue that he used Aristotle's process of deduction perfectly and showed how important it is for mathematical theory. For that he gets a \\[6\\] I guess. I'm only on the second one and I'm already getting lazy so whatever. As for his life, not much is known other than he was a great teacher and did a shit load of math. I'm assuming not much is known about his life because he didnt do a lot of cool shit. So I'm gonna shot in the dark give him a \\[3\\]. That gives Euclid a \\[6.333..\\]. Go get him Pythagoras.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Newton:**\n\nLets start with his life. Died a virgin. \\[0\\]. For his mathematical importance, calculus is pointless. And that dogshit notation? \\[0\\]. Distinguished? Ha! Stick to physics dipshit. \\[0\\]. Total: \\[0\\]. Divide by that you fucking pussy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Leibniz:**\n\nAn absolute genius. This man alone discovered calculus totally independently in amazing notation independently. Calculus is an absolutely integral (ha) part in the mathematical world today and revolutionized mathematics forever. For that, I give good ol' Gottfried a perfect \\[10\\] in mathematical applicability for the wide range of fields and advancements that would proceed his wondrous discoveries. And for the distinguish rating? This math savage didnt stop at discovering calculus. His mathematics would lead to the first ever calculator ever made using the Leibniz wheel, he restructured the binary system which is used in all computer code, and other shit with geometry. That gives him a solid \\[8\\]. For his life? The guy wound up having 3 wives. That means I bet he had sex at least 3 times, which is a lower bound of 3 more times than that other calculus guy (whats his name again?), so I give him a solid \\[8\\]. Total:  \\[8.67\\].\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Euler:**\n\nWell, lets start with the obvious. Euler is the most distinguished mathematician of all time. So an obvious \\[10\\]. First he said fuck it and found a whole ass number literally called 'e' which is short for Euler and is used in the financial industry to the most abstract mathematics out there, and all the way to raves. You cant even do a fucking Fourier transform without Euler just chilling outside the exponent of the integral. Now that is savage. You cant even fucking differentiate the mans last name in exponential form. How many of you can say that? Thought so. \\[10\\] for contribution rating. And I'm not even done with his contributions yet. He literally has a millennium problem for you ass holes to get 1 million dollars for solving. He did a trivial problem concerning land masses and bridges just for shits and giggles and the math used is implemented for the FOUNDATION OF THE INTERNET. If that doesnt inspire you then go watch a ted talk or something for fucks sake. e\\^(pi\\*i) + 1 = \\[10\\] - 10. pi\\^2/6. What the fuck else do you need to know about this mathematical genius. His life was pretty boring though other than fucking up a fountain so I give that a \\[5\\]. Total:  \\[8.3333...\\].\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cantor:**\n\n\\[inf\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats it for now. If you want me to do more let me know and I will get drunk again. Thanks for reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "postText": "I'm doing a PhD, but I feel like I don't know anything I am at a loss. I really am, and if anyone has any comments on this I'd truly appreciate them.\n\nI am a doing a PhD in maths, having completed a masters degree in pure mathematics, with focus on logic. I then moved abroad to start a PhD program (fully funded), and have been here for 18 months now.\n\nHonestly, I don't know any maths anymore. I actually wonder whether I ever knew much maths in the first place. It feels like I have to relearn so many things I used to know. I feel like I need to catch up with invisible competitors. I sometimes scroll through math stack exchange, and realise how few questions I could answer -- and I'm working towards a freaking PhD! How pathetic is that.\n\nMy supervisor wants me to focus on research questions, but I can hardly concentrate on the problems he gives me. I spend much more time looking at other maths I know I used to know, then scold myself for not remembering, then reading around a little to remind myself, just to eventually give in and pity myself.\n\nI don't know how to work myself out of this hole. My supervisor and the department seem happy with what I'm doing (just had my proposal passed), but what does that matter if I don't believe in myself? At this point (the quarantine doesn't help either, by the way), I don't feel like I know anything, and I'm just wasting their time.\n\nFinally, and that's the worst part about this all, I don't actually enjoy doing maths right now because of the headspace I'm in. If I remember how to do something, then I put it off, not as a success but as formality because I should know it anyway -- if I don't, the day is basically ruined.\n\nI guess something's fundamentally wrong here, so if anyone has any input to give me I'd really appreciate it. Hope you're all safe and doing well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am truly touched by all your thoughtful responses and encouraging words. Thank you so much for your support. \n\nPlease know that I\u2019m reading each and every single one of your messages. Quite a few of your words have led me to think deeply about myself in ways fundamentally different from what I\u2019m used to \u2014 I am stuck in my own toughts, and your perspectives have given me so much.\n\nI would have never thought that my post would receive so much feedback, especially not from quite a few of you who feel similarly. I hope things work out well for all of you, I\u2019ll keep my fingers crossed.",

Please avoid derailing such discussions into general political discussion, and report any comments that do so.\n\nTo that end, [here is a statement from the Mathematics Association of America on the BLM movement](https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/black-lives-matter).  Here is a [statement from the President of the AMS](http://www.ams.org/news?news_id=6177).  Here is a [statement from the Association for Women in Mathematics](https://awm-math.org/policy-advocacy/endorsements/#7afd956b2314f6405)\n\n\n---\n\nIt's easy to pretend that mathematics is above social justice issues such as racism, sexism, homophobia, among other forms of bigotry.  **This is absolutely not true.**  For an example of race inequality in Mathematics, we invite you to view [The Mathematical and Statistical Sciences Annual Survey](http://www.ams.org/profession/data/annual-survey/phds-awarded).\n\nIn the most recently available report on the 2016-2017 New Doctorate Recipients, 54 out of 1957  (2.76%) PhDs identified as Black/African American. From 2012-2017, that number is 239 out of 9548 (2.5%).  \n\nUnfortunately, the AMS survey of tenured faculty does not capture statistics on race.  However, the NYT Article [What I Learned While Reporting on the Dearth of Black Mathematicians](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/reader-center/black-mathematicians-research-academic-racism.html) gives us this approximation on the number of Black tenured faculty:\n\n> According to the American Mathematical Society, there are 1,769 tenured mathematicians at the math departments of the 50 United States universities that produce the most math Ph.D.s. No one tallies the number of black mathematicians in those departments, but as best I can tell, there are 13 [0.73%]. \n\nThis data should be compared to the estimated 13% black Americans among the general adult US population.\n\n---\n\nHere are further articles/blog posts for you to read, in no particular order.\n\n* [What I Learned While Reporting on the Dearth of Black Mathematicians](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/reader-center/black-mathematicians-research-academic-racism.html)\n* [For a Black Mathematician, What It\u2019s Like to Be the \u2018Only One\u2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/edray-goins-black-mathematicians.html)\n* [AMS Blog inclusion/exclusion](https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/)\n* [The Voices of Black Mathematicians](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/the-voices-of-black-mathematicians/)\n* [In Honor of Black History, a special section in the Notices of the AMS](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201802/rnoti-p118.pdf)\n* [Mathematically Gifted \\& Black](https://mathematicallygiftedandblack.com/)\n\n---\n**Edit:**  One actionable suggestion is to donate money (if you are able) to organizations that are working to combat these issues of racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.  One organization, suggested by the MAA as well as commenters below, is the **[National Association of Mathematics](https://www.nam-math.org/payment.html)**.\n\nIf you would like to suggest other organizations that do so (with a focus in mathematics), feel free to reply to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/gw4uca/rmath_will_be_closing_to_new_posts_from_12846pm/fsuwybe/).

At first glance I thought it could have been e, but nope. Weird. I tried it again with a different starting number and the same thing happened. Strange.

    "postText": "I hate that, \"I'm bad at math\" is the end of the conversation. If you were with someone who could barely read the words on a menu at a restaurant and they responded casually with, \"Oh I'm just bad a reading\" that would be unacceptable. You would be concerned about their education. They don't have to LOVE reading or be able to make out sloppy cursive writing but you'd expect them to have a certain level of competency in reading so that they do everyday tasks. \n\nIn middle school and high school I did horribly in math but my excuse was always, \"I'm just bad at math. Not like Kevin who's naturally gifted.\" And pretty much everyone just let me get away with it. Even my own teachers didn't push me very hard. It took me a long time to realize Kevin was good at math because he practiced problems everyday for the same amount of time I read books. It just seemed like the subject was one of those things you were either bad at or good at. If you needed to practice it you were already a failure starting out way behind those naturally talented humans.\n\nI've returned to college recently to pursue computer science. Basic algebra like \"10 + x = 12 what is x\" used to be the bane of my existence. Now I'm in Calculus and it still sucks but I can do it. Thanks to practice, tutors, and the internet. \n\nBut I can't help but think how much faster I could have gotten through this if my high school wasn't so quick to divide up students between \"Bad at math. Lost cause.\" and \"Naturally gifted in math. Mostly ignore.\" I wonder right now if there's a bunch of students starting their Freshmen year whose struggle will be dismissed turning them away from the growing demand and high paying positions in STEM related fields.\n\nThere are lot of problems with the U.S. and the maths and sciences but it starts with letting kids off the hook who excuse poor grades by saying, \"I'm just bad at math.\" Those are the people who should be showered with resources. Extra focus on problem chapters, reviewing failed tests, more tutors, better trained teachers, more encouragement etc. There are few things you can't do if you practice enough. You may not be the best or most gifted, but being average at something is way better than complete ignorance. ",

I\u2019m not trying to sound arrogant or anything but it\u2019s impossible to even describe to \u201cnon-math\u201d people that I\u2019m actually incredibly stupid when it comes to math. All the more reason to love the subject I guess",

    "postText": "Eigen Grandito - Principal Components Analysis of the Taco Bell menu Hey all - recently I took a deep dive into the SVD/PCA.  My goal was to understand the math with confidence, and then use it for something interesting.  In my project, NumPy's svd function does the hard work, but even still, just using it challenged my understanding in instructive ways.  Between my study and the project, I feel I truly understand, mathematically, what the SVD does and why it works.  Finally.  Feels good.\n\nAnyway, my project was to calculate the Eigen Grandito, which is named after the Onion article, \"Taco Bell's Five Ingredients Combined In Totally New Way\", which, in more mathematical terms, asserts that Taco Bell's dishes are all linear combinations of the same ingredients.  \n\nAnd so the Eigen Grandito \"recipe\" is just the first principle component of the matrix of Taco Bell dishes and their ingredients.  In theory, the Eign Grandito is the \"most Taco Bell\" of Taco Bell dishes.  \n\nHere is a link to my code and the results:\nhttp://www.limerent.com/projects/2020_11_EigenGrandito/\n\nAny feedback and corrections are welcome.

Brief summary of parts I and II in this paragraph. A few physics collaborators and I stumbled across an interesting linear algebra formula that relates eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It seemed so simple we thought for sure it must be known in the literature, but couldn't find anything. After posting here, you guys directed me to Terry Tao who promptly replied to our email with three proofs.\n\nAfter barely managing to process one proof, we decided to go for it and see if he'd like to write up a paper. I sketched up a draft figuring if we had something that already looked good he'd be more likely to say yes. He promptly replied and said sure (I screamed a little bit), offered a corollary and a few other neat observations. At this point I was two proofs, a corollary, and some other new things behind. I hacked my way through the new information and was about to send a v2 of the draft the next day when he sends another proof (now I'm three proofs behind, oof, I seriously wondered how I would ever catch up with this). At some point during this story, a colleague of mine who straddles physics and math said, \u201cHe\u2019s famously like a cheery firehose of mathematics, Guess he\u2019s power-washing you today.\u201d I felt clean.\n\nAnyway, I finally caught up and the firehose slowed down a bit. We put the paper online last weekend and it [finally appeared on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03795), along with a new [Terry blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/08/13/eigenvectors-from-eigenvalues/)! I'm so excited you guys don't even know.\n\nAs for the math, the arXiv paper is barely over two pages so you're best off reading it there or on his blog rather me trying to write formulas here on reddit. Also, as I was typsetting Terry's proofs, I had two files going, one called Math.tex (that ended up being the paper) and another called Physics.tex. The former was basically just what he had sent us slightly reformatted with a few additional notes. The latter described the first proof in enough detail such that I or my physics collaborators could understand it. The latter is about five times as long as the former, heh.\n\nTerry has been a pleasure to work with; I learned a ton and he seemed really chill whenever I would say things like, \"I have no idea how this normally works in math but...\"\n\nIn other news, my Erdos number just went from 4 to 3 where it will probably remain for the rest of my life.\n\n**Edit**: Hell, I just got gold for writing a math paper, more than I've gotten for any physics paper I've written. I just need help cashing it out so I can retire. Thanks stranger!\n\n**Edit2:** This story has not ended, there will be at least one more part.\n\n**Edit3:** The saga continues, see Part IV [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/e5zb23/terence_taos_blog_eigenvectors_from_eigenvalues_a/).",

Thanks to an experience he had in community college, and some influence from popular Physics books, he became interested in mathematics and eventually wound up at a public university in Houston, where we studied together and graduated a semester apart with degrees in Applied Mathematics.\n\nRandy went on to get a masters in Math from Rice University and completed his PhD in Math with the graph theorist Michael Henning at the University of Johannesburg.\n\nSo many people experience failure in mathematics and come away with an attitude that they can\u2019t do math.

I'm 17, going into year 13 in September, and (was) hoping to go to Cambridge to study maths in 2020. However, I attended a subject masterclass at the university this year, and the overwhelming arrogance of the other students there infuriated me. Any time the lecturer would step from one point to the next in an argument, there'd be a chorus of furious nodding from people who really wanted to show just how well they understood that step. The same would come whenever a concept beyond the A-level syllabus was mentioned even in passing, or whenever the lecturer asked who had heard of such-and-such thing before. At one point a guy at the front (who was probably the worst offender on all counts) interrupted the lecturer mid-sentence to explain to everyone a method he knew of proving something that the lecturer was literally in the middle of explaining. During a Q&A session with current Cambridge students, it was very clearly explained that there is no advantage to doing the maths A-level a year early, but you bet that didn't stop one guy from asking whether there was, perchance, an advantage to doing it two years early (wink wink nod nod).\n\nThis arrogance isn't limited to Cambridge, obviously; it pervades all of mathematics. You need only go on stack exchange to see just how many people are waiting to tell you how dumb you are for not being born knowing that there exist functions that are smooth only at a single point in their domain. It seems every maths person I talk to is just waiting to tell me how many certificates of distinction they've gotten from the British Mathematical Olympiad. I can't stand it! I don't care if you know what a stereographic projection is! I didn't ask!\n\nSorry for the long text post, but I just wanted to talk to somebody about this.

Would people be interested? Any feedback? **EDIT: The channel has been created, but no videos are up yet. I'm hard at work writing scripts, and am also obtaining the necessary equipment whenever monetary considerations allow. The name of the channel is Caeruleus: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAT9Vi4abr1ebjLrFfLjFZw.**\n\nBasically, the title.\n\nTo expand on this a bit, I've long been an advocate of the kind of work Khan Academy does, along with similar such platforms, and have also long been a fan of many of the mathematics channels on YouTube (Numberphile, Mathologer, PBS Infinite Series, Vihart,  MathDoctorBob, and /u/3blue1brown, just to name a few). My aim is not to become a competitor to these fine people, but to provide the kind of \"complete\" education that KA does, giving intuition and insight through thorough (but not overbearing!) \"lectures\", which I feel is a niche that hasn't quite been filled, except by things like OCW---which often have the slight detriment of being tailored more toward an audience that's physically present and invested by way of grades.\n\nMy idea for the format is basically just recording me writing in a notebook while explaining the concepts relevant to a particular field, and drawing frequent pictures and so on to elucidate the concepts underneath. I may or may not follow a single textbook for each such series; for example, the big idea in my head right now is a sort of walk through baby Rudin, casting light on certain things that I feel he leaves in the dark, but I may also supplement this with other classical intro to analysis textbooks.\n\nWould anyone be interested in such a thing, either for their own benefit, or for the benefit of people you may be tutoring at any given time, or for some other reason I haven't foreseen?\n\nIn addition, does anyone have any feedback on this? Either opinions, or possible suggestions for specific fields to tackle first, or pacing, or other particularities of the format, or even things related to the nuts and bolts of creating a YouTube series? Such feedback will be much appreciated.\n\n**TL;DR: I want to do math lectures for topics \"beyond\" calculus and linear algebra for free on the Internet. What do you think?**",

So, I'm not 100% certain it's new, but I googled it to 6, 7, and 8 decimal places and no one seems to have it lying around on a spreadsheet; Google gave me 0 results. Here's a fact that sets the stage for how this irrational number is calculated:\n\nFact: ***4***.**84732210185** \\^ 3 is (essentially) twice as large as ***3***.**84732210185** \\^ 3.\n\nSuppose, rather than cubing these numbers, we raised them to the power of 4, or 100? For every power, there is a pair of numbers that differ by 1 somewhere that, when raised to that power, the larger result is exactly double the smaller result.\n\nThe irrational number I seem to have discovered is the ***difference between these numbers*** that meet this criteria; the first pair is (1, 2), which corresponds to a power of 1 (because 1.0\\^**1** = 2.0\\^**1**/2), the second pair is (2.4142136, 3.4142136), and the third pair was my initial example. The difference between the first two is 1.4142, the second difference is 1.4331086, and the hundredth difference is 1.4426893.\n\nI wrote a little python program to calculate these numbers, and they seem to be approaching **something like 1.442692**, (which is suspiciously close to the cube root of 3, but it keeps climbing so we're OK) and I'm posting this here to get all your guys' expertise: is this some kind of new irrational number? How do I go about proving that it's convergent (I'm a high-school student and don't have experience with proofs)? Do you guys know a better way to calculate it?\n\nThanks for the help, and I hope you enjoy this number I've found as much as I do :) Let me know your thoughts on this number or if you've seen it before.\n\nEdits: Thanks to u/masonery123 and many others, I've fixed a few typos that threw people (including myself) for a loop.

    "postText": "Just for fun: The math of ghosting Suppose you have been texting with someone for a certain period of time, and then you don't hear from them for a while.  Are they just busy, or have you been ghosted?\n\nThis problem can be modeled with Bayesian statistics.\n\nFirst we need models for message events and for ghosting.  We assume that, up until the point that ghosting happens, messages arrive according to a Poisson process, and then stop after the ghosting event. So, in the absence of ghosting, the probability of getting no messages between t1 and t2 is given by exp(-lambda(t2-t1)), where lambda is the message arrival rate.\n\nTo model the ghosting, we assume that people are either non-ghosters (who will never ghost) or ghosters (who will definitely ghost, eventually).  The time at which a ghoster decides to ghost is also given by a Poisson process.  So if p is the probability that a person is a ghoster, and mu is the typical time at which a ghoster ghosts, then the probability of being ghosted between t1 and t2 is given by:\n\np (1-exp(-mu(t2-t1)))\n\nWe define:G=G(t1,t2)=Probability of being ghosted between time t1 and time t2\n\nNM=NM(t1,t2)=Probability of receiving no messages between t1 and t2\n\nThe problem asks: what is the probability we have been ghosted, given that we have received no messages between t1 and t2?  By Bayes' Theorem, this probability is given by:P(G|NM)=P(NM|G)\\*P(G)/P(NM)\n\nTo compute P(NM|G), we have to add up the probabilities of all the events where we were ghosted at time t in t2-t1, and also received no messages from t1 to t. So it's the integral of G(t) exp(-lambda(t-t1)).  \\[Edit:  This is not quite right, since the ghosting events are not independent-- you cannot be ghosted twice.  It will close to right though, if the ghosting rate is small relative to t2-t1.\\]\n\nFinally, P(NM) can be computed as P(NM|G) \\* P(G) + P(NM| not G)\\*P(not G).\n\nI put this computation into a Python script, attached below.  We need to choose priors for the message rate lambda, the ghosting rate mu, and the probability p that your person is a ghoster.  In the example below, I get lambda from the previous message history, p from previous conversations with other peoople, and I assume that mu decreases the longer your person talks to you.\n\nExample: Suppose your person sends you 245 messages over a period of 405 (waking) hours, but then you don't hear from them for 10 hours. Also suppose that up to this point you have had conversations with 12 other people, and 7 of those ended up ghosting. Then we edit the first five lines of the file as below, run the code, and find that there is a 71% chance we were ghosted.\n\n    ###CODE STARTS HERE. \n    total_number_of_messages=245\n    total_number_of_hours_between_first_message_and_last=405\n    number_of_hours_since_last_message=10\n    total_number_of_people_you_have_messaged=12\n    total_number_who_ended_up_ghosting=7\n    \n    ###################################################################\n    tot_ghost_prob=total_number_who_ended_up_ghosting/total_number_of_people_you_have_messaged\n    \n    ghost_rate_prior=1/total_number_of_hours_between_first_message_and_last\n    msg_rate=total_number_of_messages/total_number_of_hours_between_first_message_and_last\n    \n    import numpy as np\n    \n    ## Probability of no messages between t1 and t2, assuming no ghosting.\n    def no_msg(t1,t2):\n        return np.exp(-msg_rate*(t2-t1))\n    \n    ## Probability of no ghosting between t1 and t2\n    def no_ghost(t1,t2):\n        return (tot_ghost_prob*np.exp(-ghost_rate_prior *(t2-t1)) + (1-tot_ghost_prob))\n    \n    #Probability of ghosting happening between t1 and t2\n    def ghost(t1,t2):\n        return 1-no_ghost(t1,t2)\n    \n    #probability of receiving no messages betweem t1 and t2 and also being ghosted between t1 and t2\n    def no_msg_and_ghost(t1,t2):\n        z=0\n        # for each small interval in the time range, we compute probability that we were *not* ghosted up that point, received *no* messages to that point,\n        #  and *did* get ghosted in next interval \n        for i in range(t2-t1):\n            z+=no_ghost(t1,t1+i-1)*no_msg(t1,t1+i-1)*ghost(t1+i-1,t1+i)\n        return z\n    \n    #probability of receiving no messages between t1 and t2, given that ghosting happened between t1 and t2.\n    def no_msg_given_ghost(t1,t2):\n        return no_msg_and_ghost(t1,t2)/ghost(t1,t2)\n    \n    #probability of receiving no messages between t1 and t2, and not being ghosted between t1 and t2\n    def no_msg_and_no_ghost(t1,t2):\n        return no_msg(t1,t2)*no_ghost(t1,t2)\n    \n    #probability of receiving no messages between t1 and t2\n    def no_msg_tot(t1,t2):\n        return no_msg_and_no_ghost(t1,t2)+no_msg_and_ghost(t1,t2)\n    \n    #probability of being ghosted between t1 and t2, assuming no messages between t1 and t2\n    def ghost_given_no_msg(t1,t2):\n        return no_msg_given_ghost(t1,t2)*ghost(t1,t2)/no_msg_tot(t1,t2)\n    \n    p=ghost_given_no_msg(total_number_of_hours_between_first_message_and_last,total_number_of_hours_between_first_message_and_last+number_of_hours_since_last_message)\n    #p=ghost_given_no_msg(10,20)\n    \n    print(\"probability you have been ghosted is:\",p)",

    "postText": "I conjecture that 24968370984798709551283169 is interesting Please allow me to talk a little bit about my research. I am interested in certain sums of unit fractions, like 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5. More precisely, for positive integers a and b write the sum 1/a + 1/(a+1) + .. + 1/b as one fraction u(a,b)/v(a,b) (where numerator and denominator have no common factors). For example, v(2,5) = 60, as 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = 77/60. Then, if we fix a and view the denominator v(a,b) as a function of b, then this function often grows quite quickly, roughly exponentially fast. To give you an example, let's say a = 100 and let b run from 100 to 105. Then we get the following sums and look at the denominators on the right-hand side:      \n      \n1/100 = 1/100     \n1/100 + 1/101 = 201/10100    \n1/100 + 1/101 + 1/102 = 15301/515100   \n1/100 + 1/101 + 1/102 + 1/103 = 2091103/53055300    \n1/100 + 1/101 + 1/102 + 1/103 + 1/104 = 67632503/1379437800    \n1/100 + 1/101 + 1/102 + 1/103 + 1/104 + 1/105 = 188463347/3218688200    \n     \nFast-growing indeed!    \n    \nBut the (to me) interesting thing is that v(a,b) is not a monotonically increasing function. Even though it's a fast-growing function, sometimes if we increase b it gets smaller! As we noticed, v(2,5) = 60, whereas 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 = 29/20, so that v(2,6) = 20 which is indeed smaller than v(2,5).      \n    \nNow, let b(a) be the smallest integer b > a such that v(a,b) is smaller than v(a,b-1). That is, for fixed a, b(a) is the first violation of monotonicity. Then it can be shown that b(a) exists and is finite for every a and, more precisely, b(1) = b(2) = b(3) = 6, b(4) = 18 and b(a) < 4.38a for all a > 4. On the other hand, there are lower bounds for b(a) as well and this is where we get to the title of this post. Because in a certain sense, b(a) can not be too small; if you start with b = a and then let b grow, then for the first few values of b, v(a,b) will actually be monotonically increasing. To be exact, there is an absolute constant c > 0 such that for all positive integers a we have b(a) > a + c * log(a). Rewriting this inequality we see that (for a > 1) the quantity f(a) = (b(a) - a)/log(a) is bounded from below. In particular, I can prove that for all large enough a we have f(a) > 0.54. So if a is such that f(a) is near this value of 0.54, then this means that v(a,b) stops being a monotonically increasing function of b more or less as quickly as theoretically possible. Furthermore, there do exist some a that actually violate the inequality f(a) > 0.54. So we can ask ourselves, which integer a minimizes f(a)? And this is my conjecture: f(a) reaches its absolute minimum at a = 24968370984798709551283169 \u2248 2.5 * 10^25. For this value of a we have b(a) = 24968370984798709551283200 = a + 31, so that f(a) = (b(a) - a)/log(a) = 31/log(a) \u2248 0.5300989. Note how tiny the gap 31 is in comparison to the values of a and b themselves. Moreover, v(a,b) is in this case an integer with 767 digits. But v(a,b-1) has 768 digits, so indeed v(a,b) < v(a,b-1). And that is why (I believe) this number a is awesome; there is not a single other positive integer such that v(a,b) stops being a monotone function that quickly! Thank you for indulging me.",

Bonus points if you can come up with a non-trivial example.\n\n3) The judge listens to each player's explanations and chooses a winner (in the style of Apples to Apples, there is no concrete criteria - just whichever option the judge likes best).\n\n4) The role of the judge transfers to the next person, and play continues.\n\n---\n\nThe game often leads to either very interesting mathematical discussions or just absolutely wild BS, both of which are very entertaining. You can play for points and crown whoever has the most after N rounds as the winner, or you can just play for enjoyment. If you have enough people, using teams of two instead of individual players is also fun.\n\nDoes anybody else have any good math-based games to share? It would be especially interesting to hear about things you tried online during the pandemic.",

I personally got interested in Math by for example reading \u201cA Character of Physical Law\u201d by Richard Feynman. In this book he says that to be able to appreciate nature you have to know mathematics. So this was one of the things I found interesting and got me curious. Another good book that got me going in math is \u201cA Mathematicians Delight\u201d by Sawyer.\n\nSo the idea is to start with high school algebra(if you\u2019re really new to this). Try to master this subject. In reality you only need a subset. Do a lot of exercises and you will master it. You\u2019ll get confidence to study trig and then calculus and so on until you get to upper level university math(eg topology, differential geometry).\n\nYou can be a math person too. \n\nSo it\u2019s about being aware of your limits and going beyond them which is something Einstein said which is true.",

However, if you desire greater consistency in caffeination, you can choose to make alternating pours between two cups according to the Thue-Morse Sequence and they'll be roughly equivalent.\n\nLink to the paper: https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/13-4-3.pdf",

[Order seven Harding Traverse](http://imgur.com/EqUmtOj)\n\n  A few months ago, my dad told me a simple joke. It went as follows: \"Two statisticians were shooting arrows at targets. One of them shot 10 feet to the right, and the other shot 10 feet to the left. They both cheered and high-fived.\". \n\n   This got me thinking about how averages work. Specifically, average of locations. I modified the problem so that a marksman (one of the people firing the arrows) could only shoot directly in front of them. Then I set it up so that only one marksman could fire per turn. I then represented this using 1's and 0's (1 meaning that the marksman has fired, and 0 meaning that they haven't). For instance, if there where a row of three marksmen, and the left most marksman shot first (represented by {1,0,0}), then the average locations of all the arrows fired would obviously be directly in-front of the left most marksman. If then, after that, the right most marksman fires {1,0,1}, then the average location will have moved to the middle, directly in front of the central marksman. However, if instead the central marksman fired second {1,1,0}, the average location of the arrows will be in between the left most and central marksman. Now, I decided to represent this on graph paper, each turn (someone firing) would be represented with a step up on the y axis. The average locations of the arrows would be represented by the x axis. I graphed all the possible orders of the marksmen firing, and their subsequent averages, and got a shape that ended up looking like this:\n\n   [Order three Harding traverse](http://imgur.com/lfJrUsm) \n(the three digit numbers label the paths, showing which marksmen have fired, and which haven't. once all marksmen have fired, the average location is obviously in the middle)\n\nTake note that in later iterations of this (meaning that there are more marksmen to start off with), you get situations such as {1,1,0,1}. This value's actual average location wouldn't be directly above, or directly in between  any two marksmen, meaning that it would be difficult to graph it. Because of this, I decided that the average to {1,1,0,1} should be directly above the second 1, because it has a 1 on either side of it. This means that {1,1,1,0,0,}{1,1,0,1,0} and {1,1,0,0,1} all have the same averages. This goes for a set of an even amount of values. If there where four 1's in a value, their average location would be in between the central two 1's. \n\n   I started going further with this concept. Instead of having a messy graph represent all of the possible combinations of firing orders, I decided to just simply write all of the possibilities out in numbers:\n(this is for an order 4 situation, meaning that there are 4 marksmen.)\n\n[All possible 4 digit binary paths](http://imgur.com/vPowsjw)\n\nNow, while doing this, I noticed something very interesting. In this situation with four marksmen -[Order four Harding Traverse](http://imgur.com/bVKBq8h)-, I noticed that there where two ways to get to {1,1,0,0} (from {1,0,0,0}, and from {0,1,0,0}). This translated into the shape in that the value {1,1,0,0} (on the 2nd move, in between the first and second marksmen), where there where two lines leading in to it. This would make sense, because the lines represent the two paths from {1,0,0,0} and {0,1,0,0}. \n\n   I have yet to find anything else interesting about this problem I have made. I assume this has been done before, and has been recorded much more professionally than I have, but I have yet to find it. I leave you with the order 7 Harding Traverse, which I have named after me and my dad, who's lame joke inspired me to do all of this. Enjoy.\n\n[Order seven Harding Traverse](http://imgur.com/EqUmtOj)\n\nEdit: Huge thanks to /u/bgahbhahbh and /u/redstonerodent for all the help!

Edwards (mathematician and famous expositor of classical mathematics) has passed away on Nov.10 this month Having read a bit of his excellent book on Galois theory, I was just googling to see what else he might've written that might interest me and I noticed that on the German version of his Wiki page it says that he has passed away little over 2 weeks ago. A little research seems to confirm this and as I have found no posts regarding this on /r/math (strangely, there was one post on /r/crypto), I thought I should bring it to the sub's attention.\n\nTo those who hear of him for the first time, Edwards was a famous expositor of the classical and constructive approach to mathematics, having written many books following this approach, including the aforementioned \"Galois Theory\" (that included a translation of Galois' original paper on the subject, iirc), a popular book on Fermat's Last Theorem, another about the zeta function (that also includes a translation of Riemann's seminal paper) and others. He was a strong proponent of reading original mathematical works, a point of view presented in his \"Read the Masters!\" article.\n\nHere's the source I found: https://www.news-gazette.com/obituaries/harold-edwards/article_124f11b0-27a0-11eb-ab12-5cb9017bdfdf.html",

Tao used techniques from probability and complex analysis, among other things, to prove another case of [Sendov's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendov%27s_conjecture).\n\nI'm not really familiar with the conjecture, but it got me thinking whether it (or rather its contraposition) is somehow applicable for polynomial root isolation similar to how [Sturm's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm%27s_theorem) can be used. Or maybe the conjecture can be applied elsewhere? I found [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5167) containing some interesting related problems.\n\nThere is an [article on Tao's blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/sendovs-conjecture-for-sufficiently-high-degree-polynomials/) and a [paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04125).",

    "postText": "Just discovered an interesting number that was already well known to mathematicians, but I thought it was cool I was thinking about the Ancient Greek proof that there are infinite prime numbers. (I'm sure there are many such proofs, but the one I am thinking of goes along these lines: Assume there is a highest prime number P. Multiply P by all of the primes less than P and then add 1. The resulting number is either prime or composite. If it's prime, it's greater than P which is a contradiction. If it's composite, all of its prime factors must be greater than P which is also a contradiction. Therefore, there is no highest prime number.)\n\nAnyway, I started thinking about some examples. If P = 5, then the number I'd want to check is (5 * 3 * 2) + 1 = 31. If P = 7, then I'd check (7 * 5 * 3 * 2) + 1 = 211. Both 31 and 211 are prime, so I wrote a little program to go through primes until it found an example where (P * all the primes below P) + 1 was not prime. It turned out to be 30,031, whose prime factors are 59 and 509. 30,031 = (13 * 11 * 7 * 5 * 3 * 2) +1.\n\nIt turns out any number that can be written as (P * all primes below P) + 1 is called a Euclid Number, so 30,031 is the lowest composite Euclid Number.\n\nNot a huge achievement or deep insight into mathematics, but it's kind of cool to see something I worked out on my own had an actual name and everything.",

    "postText": "Ever since I started typesetting my homework, my homework averages and understanding in my classes have skyrocketed This isn't really a serious question of any kind, but rather an observation I've made over the past couple of years. \n\nFor most of my education, my math teachers had always been worried about my sloppy errors and losing points because of stupid mistakes. I always recognized this was a problem but didn't really care to fix it. That is until my mathematics professor from my senior year of high school taught our class about TeX. At first I just... did not get it. I couldn't understand how it worked. I put it away when I started college a year ago and took Calculus III. I handwrote all my homework problems and... sure enough, always got 0.25 points off here or 0.5 points off there for stupid errors which really impacted my homework scores. At the time too, I didn't really understand what I was doing. I was just doing the calculus and not thinking about the theory of it.\n\nThe next course I took in college was Linear Algebra for math majors, which is notoriously difficult at my university. I decided to brush off Overleaf and give it another go and type all my homework, no matter how long it took (and oh boy, it took a long time to type). I noticed a consistent increase in my homework average and comprehension of the material I was doing. Learning all the Latex commands and shortcuts was weirdly a ton of fun for me and for the first time I could 1. read my own work and 2. It looked \"official,\" like it was out of a textbook. I began trying to format it as \"professionally\" as possible, constantly looking to optimize it (though I'll never be as fast as Gilles Castel, that's for sure).\n\nMy study group friends have asked if I would recommend to them typesetting their notes, but I was always hesitant because it takes a *long* time, even if you're familiar with it. On the flip side, though, it forces me to slowly go line by line to confirm that I understand everything and that it is notationally & logically sound. It's much harder to handwave typeset math work, at least at an undergraduate level. Doing this sort of parsing whenever I did my homework I think built a better foundation for understanding the material, especially in Linear Algebra. It means that in some sense, I have to dedicate less time studying later (I still study AND make stupid errors, though :P just fewer errors). \n\nAnyways, just thought this phenomenon was interesting, I certainly hope this trend continues for me. How did you all start typesetting your math? Do you find it therapeutic or too tedious?",

    "postText": "Horrible words that should never be used anywhere in math I sometimes pick up a book, skim it, and think, ooh, this is a good book. Then when I get settled in and read it in depth I usually get turned off by words of the following sort:\n\n**Obvious, clear, trivial, easy to see, easy exercise, doesn't warrant a proof, (why?),** etc. \n\nIf something is so obvious, then don't say it at all. Otherwise just explain it without mentioning how obvious it is. I'd bet that close to 100% of these 'obvious' things aren't obvious at all to almost all readers. \n\nAnd in a lecture, I think it's a terrible practice to state or write something on the board, and then turn to the class and ask with a mocking expression \"do I need to prove this?\". Either prove it or don't. It's unlikely anyone will ask you to prove it when you have strongly hinted that it would be dumb of them to ask you to prove it. Also avoid verbalizing the phrases mentioned above during lecture. \n\nAs an extreme example, in the first five pages of Lang's Algebra, he uses the words 'trivial' probably fifty times.",

    "postText": "The English alphabet, according to math. I was talking to one of my friends recently about how most letters in the alphabet have some kind of connotation when you use them as a variable or in math in general. And then I had a free afternoon, and wrote down everything I could think of for each letter. I avoided physics conventions because those are just too much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA/a - the area of a shape or surface\n\nA,B,C,D - common sets, or often the angle to a shape in geometry. \n\nC - often a constant, most often seen as the extra bit in integration. Also, the set of complex numbers is denoted with a fancy capital C.\n\na,b,c,d - very common variables in general, the coefficients in most quadratic equations or generally in algebraic expressions, used very frequently in geometry. A common convention is that the lower case is used for side lengths, and the upper case is used for Angles. Same convention for elements in a set.\n\nd - added to another variable to represent change, or the derivative. For example, the change is height is dh.\n\ne - almost always represents Euler\u2019s number, usually not used as a variable because that\u2019s confusing\n\nf,g,h - predominantly used for functions: f(x), g(h(x)), etc. Probably not used as coefficients in equations to avoid mix ups between y = mx + b notation and function notation. \n\nh - also frequently used to denote height in geometry, and thus Calculus \n\nI - often, an identity set or an identity of any kind is denoted with a capital i. \n\ni - the square root of negative 1, an imaginary number. Rarely used as a common variable to avoid this mix-up\n\nj,k,l - common functions and coefficients. Sometimes, they are used alongside a,b,c to show variables of two different sources interacting, like the coefficients from two equations.\n\nl - also used for length, generally a shit variable because it looks like 1. Your professor will write a curly l to avoid this problem.\n\nm - slope, general variable use\n\nN - a fancy capital n is the set of all Natural Numbers: either the integers from zero to infinity, or the integers from 1 to infinity. Depends who you ask.\n\nn - usually to represent some number, or some fixed number. Probably because number starts with n, or because n is for N-ything.\n\nO - O is for the origin, or the point (0,0), or (0,0,0), etc. You know, the point where all the axes you\u2019re working with meet. Generally a shit variable because it looks like zero. If there\u2019s and o with a slash through it, that means naught, or the empty set. \n\np,q - P and Q are used in logic. P and Q usually represent statements that are true or false, and can interact in lots of fun ways. Also used in reasoning and sometimes philosophy.\n\np - p is often for a point on a graph, and so the variables around it are used for that too. Again, a good general variable.\n\nQ - a fancy uppercase Q is the set of all rational numbers, so named because they are quotients, or numbers that can be represented as the quotient of two integers.\n\nR - and uppercase fancy R is the set of all Real numbers. If it\u2019s on the typical number line, it\u2019s a real. Just no imaginary numbers, like i.\n\np,q,r,s,t- there is almost no convention for these variables, and you can pretty much use them for anything. \n\nu,v - In calculus you use u and v for u-substitution, probably because they look so similar that you\u2019ll remember that they can be substituted, but it\u2019s actually dumb and you always mix them up. Used in other stuff all the time, be very careful about drawing little tails so you know what you\u2019re writing.\n\nw - Often used with u and v, also confusing. W often refers to width in geometry, and occasionally a fourth dimension. \n\nx - The celebrity, as far as variables go. Probably the very most common, especially in algebra. It is almost always associated with the x-axis, which conventionally goes horizontally (picture a, x getting sat on and flattening to a horizontal line). x will also often be avoided because it is so strongly associated with graphing or solving, or because it gets confusing with a multiplication or Cartesian product operation. You probably don\u2019t want to make your constant or coefficient x, because people will automatically assume it\u2019s a variable.\n\ny - The result of an equation, the pairing that goes with x. Y is just as common as x, but gives you a result instead of an initial condition. It is conventionally displayed on a vertical y-axis (the y folds up straight like a chair). Y is avoided for many of the same reasons as x, since it is so strongly associated with graphing and algebra. Also, it feels a bit odd to have a y without an x, which isn\u2019t so much the case the other way around. \n\nZ - written in fancy script, this is the set of integers. It\u2019s denoted with a Z because the germans got to define this one, and Z is the first letter of zahlen, or numbers. Go figure.\n\nz - used with x and y often as a third variable. Your math professor will write the little line through the middle, like old people do with the number 7. They do this to separate it from the number 2. Z often represents the third dimension, which is drawn on 2-d paper in many different ways, but generally points out of the paper, towards you.\n\nEdit: Wow! I\u2019m so happy a lot of people saw this and responded! I can\u2019t believe how many obvious uses I missed, and I should probably brush up in my statistics literacy... It\u2019s also crazy that so many numbers have an association that I didn\u2019t realize until someone pointed it out. I\u2019m glad to have thought to search up this sub.",

And a colleague\n\nOne of the purposes is to allow anyone to watch the video and have the ability to take something away from it, which I think would be really interesting to have mathematicians do. Math has a somewhat notorious reputation for being very esoteric and misunderstood, so I feel as if the sharing of thoughts would be beneficial. I'd like for this to gain traction so please try to share it around with others so that we can get as many responses as possible!",

    "postText": "Why is proof-based math not taught in elementary/high school curriculum? As a math major in the US, my first introduction to proof based math was only once I got into math courses which only math majors take. But this is where I really fell in love with math, it\u2019s where I feel I really started to understand math and what I was actually doing. \n\nI totally understand the people who feel math is boring, not creative or interesting etc. The math they were taught wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t representative of what math is really like. \n\nBy the time you\u2019re 18-19 in the US, you\u2019ve taken more than a decade of math classes. You\u2019ve probably taken basic math, algebra, trig, calculus. All these classes are not that interesting in my opinion, they are all sort of algorithmic which lends itself to learning without understanding. For example, you see a particular problem with numbers and variables. You learn a series of sort of general steps that can be taken somewhat blindly and produces an answer. \n\nProof-based math is entirely different. There is no algorithmic process you can memorize to complete a proof. Each proof requires a deeper understanding, and often a creative approach. \n\nSometimes you come across a proof so simple and so elegant it inspires a kind of awe at its beauty, much the same kind of awe as a beautiful scene in nature or a painting. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t see why this should be out of grasp for a typical high school student. There are many simple, elegant proofs that demonstrate important mathematical concepts that are easily understood, such as the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, or of the infinitude of the primes. \n\nAnd it seems like a basic understanding of this gives an important conceptual understanding for the context of math. To learn a series of memorizable steps to compute something a calculator could do for you seems less useful than gaining an understanding of the nature of math, that it is explicitly a logical system built up from axioms by proofs. Or at least some sense of the logical rules which math depends on. \n\nI just happened to take a proof-based math class out of interest on the side, and I discovered something so beautiful. Had I not done that on a whim, I wouldn\u2019t have known how interesting math is, and wouldn\u2019t be a math major. So it seems like not offering at least some sampling of that material to general ed students is a disservice.",

If she gets it right, I'll pick up dinner.

She looked around the room, at her feet, made gurgling noises, and finally said, \"Um, one-third x cubed?\"\n\nSo the cynic paid the check.

I'm a 3rd year math bachelor and I like working through math books in my own pace and dive deep into the topics and do all the exercises. But when it comes to the university classes it's always just reading notes and doing the homework problems and I don't feel I'm getting anything out of it. Usually the notes are so poorly explained that I have to use Wikipedia and Stackexchange to understand what is going on. And since the pace is so high I usually don't have time to verify every step of a proof so I never feel like I understand the subject. But I did some self study in some books during the summer break and then I felt like I had time do understand the proofs and really grasp the subject . In the classes my focus is always on not falling behind so it feels like I'm doing math because I have to, not because I want to. If I had the option I would self study math instead of going to university but that's not an option since I want a degree.\n\nAnyone else feel the same way?",

Good evening, I hope you are all doing well.\n\nSo recently I switched majors into CS meaning that I was required to take math. I have terrible math performance anxiety and I was scared I wouldn't get it, or hate it.\n\nWell, I've had the complete opposite reaction and I have really been enjoying the class. I'm actually really looking forwards to math and I may want to take calculus just because.\n\nI just wanted to say thanks for the motivation and I look forwards to reading here.",

    "postText": "Explaining to nonmathematicians how easy it is for us to tell that their proof of the twin prime conjecture is wrong. The other day, we had a couple of claimed proofs of famous open problems, one of whom complained about this sub's poor attitude toward such things. This made me wonder how I would explain to someone who wasn't a mathematician just how easy it is to tell that their work is somewhere between wrong and nonsense.\n\nHere's an attempt, which I thought might amuse.\n\nImagine that you work for NASA, trying to find more efficient ways to propel spacecraft. One day, a small child knocks on your office door, and announces that they've solved your problem - they've discovered an amazing new way to launch spacecraft, which is much better than all previous methods. We'll be exploring the solar system in no time. They pull a toy spaceship out of their bag, and show it to you. This spaceship has a bar of soap taped to the side. The child tells you that the soap reduces the friction between the spaceship and the atmosphere. They turn, and hurl it out your window. You hear a faint, indignant, squeak.\n\nYou consider your response. Your new friend has made several mistakes, of varying severity. There are problems with their approach, both obvious and slightly-less-obvious, they don't seem to understand much about the existing theory, and ... they're just wrong. You can see their spaceship being dragged away by a slightly dented squirrel.\n\nYou give it a try anyway, because it's nice that they're enthusiastic and you enjoy explaining things, but there's no way that they're correct. It doesn't matter how much they can explain to you about soap, this construction will not help. It doesn't matter how good they think their throwing arm is, they will not be able to launch a spaceship this way.\n\nThis is more or less what we're thinking when we read your 'proof' of the twin prime conjecture.",

So for those who don't know already, Gregori Perelman is a Russian Mathematician who proved the Poincare conjecture, and subsequently declined the Fields medal and his million dollar Millennium prize because he felt like he didn't deserve it.  \n\nNow, for some background, I'm a phd student interested in geometry, and I'm participating in a seminar run by a postdoc this semester.  \n\nWe met today, and at the end, I was mentioning to him that I'd love to give a talk on Ricci flow at some point, but wasn't sure about what background would be needed, and then I brought up Perelman to him, since he used Ricci flow in his proof.  He then says to me that my (prospective) advisor was a graduate student when Perelman published his proof on the arXiv, and around this time, Perelman led a workshop on Ricci flow and some of his proof ideas at UC Berkeley (or the MSRI which is also right there I think).  \n\nAnyways, apparently a good friend/mentor of my advisor (who's now a prof at UCLA I think, and I'll just refer to as \"G\") attended this workshop and had some interesting interactions with Perelman while there.  These are the two stories I heard: \n\n* Right before giving one of his talks, Perelman challenged G to a footrace up a path on the campus of UC Berkley (to where the talk was I guess).  The path was very curvy.  So Perelman, in order to save time, ran up the hill the path was on without staying on the path itself.  He got very wet/muddy in the process, but still gave the talk right afterwards as if nothing happened.  He still lost btw.\n\n* Perelman and G were out on the streets of Berkeley when they got mugged.  G gives up his wallet to the mugger.  Perelman, on the other hand, says to him \"What are you doing with your life, doing this??\" without giving the mugger anything.  The mugger ran away after this, so I guess it worked.\n\ntl;dr: Gregori Perelman is an absolute gigachad.",

I had never seen anyone so genuinely offended and infuriated by how math can lead to different results than what you would expect by \"common sense\" (that in some sense real numbers are a bigger infinity than naturals, but rationals are the same infinity as naturals). Usually \"non-math\" people will just react with some dose indifference, but she was just so upset that math wasn't what she thought it was, and that people could just make new math up that I couldn't stop laughing. I just never knew anyone could be so bitter about a field they dont't interact with beyond their early education! \n\nHas anyone of you ever had a similar reaction from someone? What do you think is the cause?

    "postText": "International student surviving in a Russian university: how Latex saved my life Hi guys!\n\nI'm from Argentina, studying at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). Came here with practically no knowledge of the language, studied Russian for a year, and then started my bachelor's degree (Physics and Mathematics) completely on Russian. \n\nI remember my first few weeks very clearly. I quickly realized I was way behind, since the preparation people here get during high school is insane. It doesn't help I had to spend half my time translating before I could get to actually studying. \n\nHere everything is proof based. For the final exam, you are expected to know over 60 theorems and their proofs. Just understanding those things is hard... how was I supposed to get all of that in my head? All of that for one subject: mathematical analysis. Physics was also very much a struggle, but this was a whole different level.\n\nOne thing that helped me while learning Russian was Anki, spaced repetition software. I thought, well, if I want to learn a proof, I should try to write it down several times until I got it right. Each time I'd have to look less and less at the textbook. Now, what if I had an algorithm help me, so that I was 'reviewing' more often the parts where I struggled the most? I had little time, so I had to be effective. This is exactly what anki or other SRS does. It's supposed to make you review a card right before you forget it, this way you train yourself to recall.\n\nThat's when I decided to try and make some flashcards with Latex. I started out small, with a few theorems that were giving me a hard time, and I realized that it was working. Of course, this is no shortcut for understanding a proof, that's a step prior to this, and without understanding, you have nothing. My idea was to train myself to remember the logic behind a proof, so that I could remember all the steps.\n\nGuess what? It worked! I was able to study practically all those theorems and proofs, and passed the semester!\n\nI wanted to ask, is this a popular thing? I know there is sort of a controvery because, of course, you can't memorize a proof, but I think this is just an optimized way to do what we were already doing, isn't it?\n\nI wrote a guide, in case anyone is interested: [https://sofiabelen.github.io/selfstudy/Russian-education-maddness.html](https://sofiabelen.github.io/selfstudy/Russian-education-maddness.html)",

She has also donated her examiner fees from last year to the maths legal fund.

    "postText": "[Idea for authors] Make a math textbook consisting only of motivations for every definition and theorem of a given subject **edit:** u/algebraic_penguin made a wiki for this very purpose! http://the-motivation-behind.wikidot.com/\n\n*So if you are passionate in a subject of math and understand not only the logic behind proofs but also the* ***motivation*** *behind definitions and theorems (i.e. why this definition? why interesting? how discovered?), then do contribute! This is unchartered territory!*\n\n***\n\nMotivation not in the sense of self-help but explaining the human, historical, conceptual side to why *this* particular definition or axiom chosen (when there are usually numerous logically equivalent ones) or why even bother proving this lemma or theorem.\n\n\nIntended as a supplement to a traditional math textbook of course.\n\n\nThe problem with some textbooks is that it makes people scratch their heads thinking \"Huh? But why define it *that* way?\" or \"Huh? Why would this theorem even be *interesting*?\" or \"What led you to even discover that theorem?\"\n\nHence, I propose to have **motivation books** that address this. Logic is important too of course, and that arises from **traditional textbooks**. But the human needs a story, an *informal* reason why.\n\n \nMy inspiration is the book [Burn Math Class](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465053734/) which has a good exposition in its preface as to why the above process is extremely important pedagogically. Its subject is Calculus, and it truly motivates the definitions and theorems, explaining how to derive a precise definition from one's intuitions. E.g. it devotes several pages to explain [why rise/run is the best definition for slope](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/8raj87/comment/e0q1o6g). I think most redditors here would of course be familiar with Calculus, but this book is worth reading for its unique methodology (and also its GEB-style dialogues).\n\nThis book also says that this process (which it calls Pre-Mathematics) is important because it is the bread and butter of research mathematicians all the time. They don't only deal with known definitions, but have to come up with their own, informally deriving it from their intuitions. So a good education to this *process* is important for the mindset of a future mathematician.",

Note: Not a question, just a discussion starter.\n\n[Graham\u2019s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number) is a whole number, but it\u2019s so ridiculously large that you can\u2019t even comprehend its value.\n\nIf you tried to write down Graham\u2019s number, you could not, because the number of digits in it, say there are `a` of them, is so large that there\u2019s not enough space in the observable universe to write down them all. Even if each digit took up a Planck-volume sized region of space (a Planck volume is orders of magnitude smaller than a proton, and that\u2019s an understatement), there would still be too many digits to be contained in the observable universe.\n\nIn fact, even `a`, which is the number of digits in Graham\u2019s number, is *itself* so large that you could not write it down, because the number of *its* digits, say there are `b` of them, is so large that there aren\u2019t enough Planck volumes in the observable universe to contain them all.\n\nIn fact, even `b` is a number so large that you could not write out *its* digits (say there are `c` of them). This process continues for a number of times so large that even *the number of times this process repeats* exceeds the number of Planck volumes in the observable universe.\n\nThis blew my mind when I learned it, so just sharing it any fellow math nerds out there.\n\n(If you\u2019re having trouble imagining this, suppose some really large number `N` has a million digits (let `a` be 1,000,000). Then in a very small universe containing fewer than a million Planck volumes, you could not write down `N` because it has too many digits. But, you *could* write down `a` itself (which is 1,000,000), because it only has 7 digits (let `b` be 7, and since `b` has one digit, let `c` be 1). Well, Graham\u2019s number is so large that this sequence of variables `a, b, c, d, \u2026`, is too large to even fit in the universe.)",

    "postTitle": "Being a mathematician at a job fair - some lessons I learned.",
    "postText": "Being a mathematician at a job fair - some lessons I learned. So there was a job fair recently that was organized by our university. It lasted two days and I took the chance to talk to lots and lots of companies there. Let me say right from the start that I didn't look for something specifically there and definitely not for a job because I didn't even finish my Bachelor yet. I just wanted to check my market value. Here are some lessons I learned from it: \n\n1) Do some applied mathematics when you want to make your degree more marketable. It makes a hell of a difference. For example, I talked to a recruiter of an auditing company. When I told her that I was studying mathematics, she looked totally confused. \n\n\"Mathematics? Like ... pure mathematics? No, what are we supposed to do with that? We're an auditing company!\"\n\n\"Yes, but lots of mathematicians work in auditing companies, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but ... I mean, pure mathematics?\"\n\n\"Well, I attend some applied subjects to make myself more marketable, like insurance mathematics, numerical analysis or cryptography.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay! Yeah, this works! Yes, a lot of mathematicians work for us!\"\n\nThis talk was as dumb as it sounds, and she didn't have any clue what I was talking about, but the fact that I could throw the word \"applied\" in there changed her mind completely. \n\n2) Companies don't look explicitly for mathematicians but still want them. There was a list of all the companies that attended the job fair and they were supposed to mark which kind of majors they prefer. From over 180 companies, there were like 5 companies that prefered someone majoring in \"Mathematics, Physics or Chemistry\" (note that not a single insurance company or bank was there, I don't know why though). Depressing, right? Well, I talked to the other companies anyway, and it turned out that they would like to hire mathematicians respectively that a lot of mathematicians are already working for them. \n\nAuditing company (not the one from above): \"We don't have much experience with mathematicians, but the idea sounds wonderful actually. Are you interested in an internship?\" \n\nCompany for environmental technology: \"We love mathematicians! We have a department full of mathematicans developing algorithms for us. They are so rare unfortunately!\"\n\nIT-Consulting: \"As long as you know a little bit of coding, you're fine. You should be able to work yourself through the relevant aspects of the job anyway.\" (in other words: \"You studied mathematics. You're extremly smart. We can benefit from that.\")\n\nEngineering firm: \"Well, we're actually looking for engineers, but your profile seems to fit perfectly. You want to write your thesis with us?\" (the fact that I heard Numerical analysis made them love me)\n\nThis leads me to the next point.\n\n3) Learn. How. To. Code. That's crucial. It's going to make the job hunt a dozen times easier. Even if you're not writing software later, it's still important to have at least a solid foundation in one well known programming language in a lot of jobs nowadays (see the example with the IT-Consulting firm).\n\n4) Don't reinforce stereotypes. As a mathematician, you are an anti-social nerd by nature, at least that's what many non-mathematician will see in you. I took a fellow student of mine to the job fair too and he did extremly bad, even though he had extremly good assets (loves coding and numerical stuff). Unfortunately, he is the type of guy that you think of when you hear the word \"mathematician\", so he didn't stand a chance there and will probably have lots of problems when it comes down to real interviews in the future.\n\n5) Next to the offer of writing my thesis at an engineering company, I was also talked into a potential internship in the area of Business Intelligence. When I looked at the specific job posting later on, I realized that I don't fit into this category at all, but the HR guys didn't seem to care. As a mathematician, you can work in so many different areas that aren't obvious at all in the first place because people are going to give you a chance just because you are a mathematician. Use this. This is a gift. \n\nTl;dr: Being a mathematician can be great if you are willing to make yourself more marketable and if you are capable of selling yourself.\n",

    "postText": "Why do people think it's weird a woman loves maths? I lost my husband (divorce), daughter (university) and job (covid) last year and am really not regretting any of those things for a minute! Reason why: at the age of 42, I've been able to spend three or four hours every day on something that fascinated me ever since my teen years but which I never had the time for. I just love math!\n\nStarted off with calculus and since have been working my way through various topics and recently finished linear algebra. Now just started looking at the math for quantum physics which looks wonderful! (Using the Susskind Theoretical Minimum book.)\n\nJust one thing, when people ask me what I'm doing with my time and I say \"math\", I get a look as if I'd just said \"actually I'm a martian who has landed from outer space\". Is this because I'm a woman and women don't study math or do all you mathematicians get the same reaction?",

    "postText": "One of the coolest feelings is looking back on a class you've taken once you've gained more mathematical maturity and seeing it in an entirely new light I remember taking Linear Algebra in my first year of college. And while I had a pretty good grasp of the material and did well in the class, I was confused when our professor tried to start talking about vector spaces and how we could generalize the ideas we covered to things other than the vectors we had been working with all year. I could kind of see what she meant, but the ideas all felt very fuzzy.\n\nNow toward the end of my second year, I had the opportunity to flip through Axler's *Linear Algebra Done Right*, and I was amazed at how clear the abstract ideas he presented seemed and how well I understood his definition of linear algebra as being the study of \"linear maps on finite-dimensional vector spaces\". A year ago, when I was taking Linear Algebra, that definition would've seemed pretty odd and unmotivated. But now it seems like a very accurate description of what the heart of Linear Algebra is about. And the idea of abstracting away from just thinking about vectors and matrix multiplication specifically to thinking about vector spaces and linear mappings seems very beautiful.\n\nI'm definitely going to take some time working through Axler's book now that I have enough mathematical maturity to appreciate the abstraction and teaching he uses.",

    "postText": "I feel cheated. Where are those cool \"mathsy\" careers that every math website always talks about? The title kind of says it all. I'm at a point now where I feel incredibly cheated, and I've been on /r/math long enough to know I'm not the only one.\n\nAs a case in point, go to the \"What do Mathematicians Do?\" section of the AMS website, and read what it says. You'll see wonderful things, among others:\n\n* Astronomy and space exploration\n* Climate study\n* Medicine\n* National security\n* Robotics\n* Animated films\n\nSIAM's list is even bigger, listing anything ranging from aerospace engineering to the chemical industry.\n\nLet's be clear here. I don't know of a single mathematician working in astronomy and space exploration, and all the other fields (except for maybe epidemiology) have so few jobs available for mathematicians, you might as well try to get tenure at a university somewhere.\n\nThe problem with these websites is that they've probably been written by baby boomers (which I don't think is an unrealistic assumption looking at the average age of people on various committees at these mathematical associations). Since the days when boomers went to college, all STEM fields have drastically been mathematicized, to the point where any reputable university's mechanical engineering department will teach students about modelling and will have mathematics courses that are far more comprehensive than they were 50 years ago.\n\nAdd to that the fact that Master's degrees are far more popular now than they once were, and consider that many mechanical engineering master's degrees will have some finite element analysis and other more mathematical tools of the trade incorporated into the curriculum, and what do you get?\n\nYou get a job market in which the most interesting mathematical jobs are taken up by engineers and physicists, maybe even computer scientists. If employers have to choose between somebody with a lot of mathematical knowledge but zero domain knowledge, or somebody with less mathematical knowledge but a whole lot more domain knowledge, they'll always go for the latter. And you can't blame them. Anything a mathematician can in terms of mathematics, a physicist can too (save for some useless theoretical stuff that only academic mathematicians care about). Anything a mathematician can in terms of computer science, a computer scientist can probably do much better (and some reputable uni's have pretty mathematical compsci programs anyways).\n\nAnd whenever we're confronted by this elsewhere on reddit, we get defensive (I'm guilty of doing it too) and we start firing off the multitude of different jobs a mathematician could *hypothetically, potentially, theoretically, in principle* work in. And how it's not just the degree that counts, but our *\"analytical problem solving skills\"* (protip: every department says this about their degrees, be it philosophy or civil engineering...**and they're all right, that's what a college degree is for - especially in the hard sciences**!) And we don't even believe in our own apologetics, as evidenced by the many bland lifeless replies in every *\"working mathematicians of reddit, what do you do?\"* thread we have every so often. It's always the same jobs *cough software engineer cough* and they're rarely ever cool and challenging in any meaningful mathematical way. These are always followed up by a subtle outpour of frustration with the job market for mathematicians.\n\nMeanwhile, hydrogeologists are toying around with cool complex groundwater models, aerospace engineers work with all sorts of aerodynamical flow problems, electrical engineers use more abstract mathematics on a daily basis in signals analysis, digital filtering etc than most of us ever will in our day to day jobs, and don't even get me started on physicists...and this is all industry I'm talking about, first-hand experience. And none of this is particularly exceptional.\n\nI feel cheated. Not just by these associations and their ilk, but also by academia and my own university. Professors and study advisers pulling in more and more students on the basis of these false expectations so their departments grow in size, gravity, independence and therefore, research grants. I feel like I was lied to by a bunch of a-holes who are prepared to sell me any story I wanna hear just so they can keep doing their precious mathematics research in their precious vacuums. I'm really not happy about this, and I have a hard time believing all the grad student and non-grad students who realize academia is killing and turn to industry are either.",

    "postText": "The late impostor, and professorship struggles This subreddit is ripe with posts from young and aspiring mathematicians struggling with impostor syndrome, be it at the high school, undergrad, or PhD level. This is of course a big issue that most of us have faced at some point. But there is very little discussion about the struggles that come later in the academic career, when you finally have that tenured and cushy position that you and everybody have been dreaming about. They tend to be of quite a different nature, e.g.:\n\n\\- Impostor syndrome takes a different form. You know that you can do the job, write papers regularly, get them into good journals. What you do seems like black magic to many people, but your feeling is that you have found a few cheat codes which you are applying repeatedly to carve your niche without gaining any insight. You have figured out the cheat codes of some/many people in your field and look at their papers with the same disdain as yours. There are still a few outliers (often in other fields) however who are doing black magic, and you feel like you will never achieve anything significant compared to them.\n\n\\- When you look back at your old papers, things have matured enough in your mind that you think that they are all trivial.\n\n\\- You have PhD students. You try teaching them your tricks. If they're not good, they don't get very far and you feel like you failed them. If they're good, they figure out your tricks and now you feel that they're doing as bad a job as you are. You also failed them.\n\n\\- You apply to million euros/dollar grants selling stuff that you have either already finished, you find trivial or you already know doesn't work. You wonder if that's what everybody does. You don't want the money anyways: this would mean more PhD students and more failures. You still apply.\n\n\\- You lost your curiosity: you only care about stuff that you can turn into papers.\n\n\\- (a variant of this:) You work for years on some problem. Someday a solution pops up on the arXiv. You start reading it, it looks correct. Then you stop because it solved everything and there's nothing to improve on. You realize that you didn't care about the problem and just wanted a paper.\n\n\\- After judging them severely for the better part of your life, you begin to understand all these old professors who gave up on research, or those that turned towards mostly administrative duties. You're scared of becoming like them exactly because of how severely you judged them before.\n\n\\- You are invited everywhere to give talks. You are bored of your own talks.\n\n\\- It is very hard to open to anyone about these issues. Given the huge pressure on the job market, you feel super guilty to not fully enjoy your dream position. You keep putting on the hyper-enthusiastic show that you have been hired for whenever you talk to someone, go to conferences or give talks. \n\nI have been tenured for almost ten years and have struggled with all of these. If these feelings ring a bell for you, I am interested in hearing how you cope with them, and perhaps how you overcame them. I feel that the anonymous nature of reddit could be useful for this, as IRL discussions on these topics are very hard to come by. Feel free to send me a DM if you prefer, and we could create a small anonymous support group for midlife-crisis professors.",

    "postText": "\"Unspillable\"/\"Liquid-holding\" curves Have you ever tried to remove water from a tire? It's next to impossible, because tires curve inwards. So, I'd like to formalize such a concept. Take for example [this U-shape](https://imgur.com/a/xbjCS9n) \\- it is impossible to remove all the water from it by rotating it slowly, even though it is not a closed curve (note that some water may be removed). In other words, it can always be returned to the original state after any sequence of rotations.\n\n(Note that I said we're rotating it very slowly - there's no inertia or anything like that).\n\nAnother interesting example is the \"[contained cup](https://imgur.com/a/yQdm7vT)\" - a very simple shape that can return to the initial state only after some limited rotations, but after it \"spills\", its range increases slightly. When all of the water is removed from the cup, it becomes entirely unspillable (can return to the \"original\" position after any sequence of rotations). If it starts with too much water it becomes unspillable as well.\n\nSo, as you can see, there are quite a few variables to consider. A given shape can have different \"returning ranges\" for different amounts and locations of water, or can switch states in interesting ways. For some curves, I think it is possible that returning from a given state would take a vastly different sequence of rotations than just reversing the one we used to get there.\n\nFirst of all, it would be good to have a solid definition, which is easier said than done. Has anyone encountered such a question before? Is this a known problem? If not, does anyone have any ideas how to formally define such curves (in two dimensions or more)? Ultimately it would be great to somehow classify them or provide a simple algorithm for checking the maximum unspillable amount of water for a curve.\n\nEdit: notice that water in a tire will never \"fall\" (stop touching the surface). Does there exist a 2D unspillable, non-closed curve with that property?",

I'm not sure how to best explain this, the closest thing I can think of is a concept made by   Kierkegaard which I think is called \"dread of choice\" or \"anxiety of choice,\" or something along those lines. Basically, when I am \"forced\" to study math (and by being forced, I mean, my grades hang in the balance), I do fine. In fact, most of the time I excel. However, during breaks from school, I don't study math as I desire to. I have purchased so many books to self-study certain topics, but when it comes down to it, I never get to studying them on my own. It's like a combination of this dread of choice, as well as lack of feedback involved with self-study, on top of anxiety that I'll look through the  book and realize I've been fooled into thinking I'm good at math but in reality I can't even study an intro book on my own. I find myself thinking \"I can start studying this during my next break,\" but I never get around to it. \n\nHopefully this isn't too much of a ramble, but I'm wondering if anyone experiences similar feelings, and how they deal with it. It feels like a variation of the infamous impostor syndrome, but with different reasons behind it.\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone for the responses.

    "postText": "It is never too late for you to learn mathematics! This probably doesn't need to be its own post, but every second day there's some post, whether it be here or /r/learnmath asking if it's too late for someone to learn math or if they aren't smart enough to learn math. The answer is always, 'it is never too late!' so I feel this may be useful to a lot of people struggling with motivation issues when it comes to learning math.\n\nAnyone of any age can learn as much math as they want as long as they do it in the correct order (no sense starting at calculus when you haven't done precalc) and are willing to invest the time to really understand it. In the words of [my favourite youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk8q500rYo4) (which I highly recommend watching, especially if you are studying physics), if you want something bad enough, you can have it.\n\nFor *almost* everyone, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) is a fantastic starting point. Other YouTube channels, notabley [PatrickJMT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFe6jenM1Bc54qtBsIJGRZQ) and [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT) are particularly useful for more advanced mathematics (there are *plenty* of other channels, but these are the first few that come to mind, a lot more sources are [located in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/2mkmk0/a_compilation_of_useful_free_online_math_resources/)). If you struggle to learn effectively from YouTube videos, then your options are still numerous! Math textbooks are a very valuable source of *specialised* information, and some are also [located in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_some_good_books_on_topic_x.3F). \n\nFor the people that won't benefit from Khan Academy (i.e. those who have already learnt the content), textbooks on advanced topics and university courses on the topics are excellent. MIT OpenCourseWare, mentioned earlier, has lecture material from a lot of MIT courses, however, the main downfall of this is you often don't have access to the problem sets which are crucial for learning math, leading to my next paragraph.\n\nIt's really important to remember that if you want to get 'good' at math (realistically you are getting better at problem solving, not specifically math itself), then you will **HAVE** to do practice problems. Nothing quite solidifies your understanding of a topic like doing problems. Depending on the topic, it can be quite difficult to find practice problems, however, problems everything from arithmetic to advanced calculus should be relatively simple to find. Some useful ways to find such problems are:\n\n* Googling for the topics keywords\n\nPhrases such as 'Topic x practice problems' or 'Topic x exam questions' is often sufficient to find problems.\n\n\n\n* Textbook problems\n\nAlmost all textbooks include sections at the end of each chapter which have some problems to help you get contextual applications for the topic. Sometimes these problems may not have solutions, in these cases, you may be able to plug the problem into [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) or  asking in /r/learnmath or some other math forum (such as [Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/).\n\n\n\n* YouTube videos on the topic\n\nMost of the time (if not always), YouTube videos will work through a few problems. It is highly recommended that you attempt the problem *before* the working or solution is shown. This will greatly help with your mathematical intuition, a skill which can *only* be learnt by doing problems.\n\nTo everyone who believes that they are 'bad' at math, or aren't 'smart' enough to learn math, or it's too late for them to learn math, it isn't, as long as you **want** to learn math, you **can** learn math.\n\nAs a final word, if you are struggling with where to begin your math journey, Khan Academy has a service which lets you take some miniature math tests to assess where there are gaps in your knowledge. If you are recently returning to math, after say a few years out of highschool, I highly recommend taking the Khan Academy placement tests. If you are still in high school, this is also useful as it guides you as to what you could learn next.\n\nWhile there is no definitive order to learn math, a fairly logical progression is:\n\n* Arithmetic\n\nWhile this is extremely basic, it is technically the starting point.\n\n* Basic algebra\n\nApplying and extending arithmetic to a general system.\n\n* Basic geometry\n\nApplying basic algebra to form relations between a shape on a plane and its physical quantities.\n\n* Functions and algebra\n\nLearning about powers, square roots and logarithms, then learning the algebraic operations regarding these functions. \n\n* Trigonometry and geometry\n\nApplying what was learnt in basic geometry to more advanced structures, while learning about ratios between sides of triangles.\n\n* Advanced algebra\n\nExtending everything from algebra to trigonometry in preparation for calculus.\n\n* Differential calculus\n\nTraditionally begins with investigating limits, series and continuity, and then forming classical definitions for derivatives and relating derivatives to rates of change.\n\n* Integral calculus\n\nBeginning with Riemann sums and then learning the classic 'area under the curve' definition of an integral, and then relating this to a derivative.\n\n* Linear algebra\n\nGeneralising algebra to n dimensions, learning vector representation, matrix representation and then how to solve algebraic systems using matrices.\n\n* Multivariable calculus\n\nGeneralising differential and integral calculus to mulitple dimensions, learning partial differentiation, double and triple integrals, and limits and series in multiple dimensions.\n\n* Differential Equations\n\nExtremely useful for modelling systems, differential equations applies techniques from calculus and linear algebra to solve systems changing with time and space.\n\n* Vector calculus\n\nBegins with parametric equations and investigates vector quantities in changing vector fields. Generally includes vector field analysis Green's theorem, Gauss' theorem, path integrals, surface integrals, and flux integrals.\n\n* Partial differential equations\n\nGeneralising differential equations to multiple dimensions.\n\nThis is basically rambling now so I'll end it here. Almost all of this information is in the sidebar. You aren't too old to learn math, you aren't too young to learn math, you aren't too stupid to learn math, you can do it! It isn't too late, don't be afraid to ask for help. But learning math isn't enough, you *need* to make sure you learn how to apply it, or you'll forget.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIt isn't too late to learn math, **anyone** can do it if the time is put in, just for the love of Gauss, do practice problems!",

    "postText": "Do you think we will reach a point where we can no longer do math because of the small lifetime humans have? The title is not very clear but I could not find a way to express it better. To restate my question in better terms, let me start with these assumptions:\n\n- The lifespan humans have is limited, at least currently, there is a strong upper bound on the amount of years one singular person can live.\n- Mathematical knowledge keeps growing, whether linearly or very very slowly, but it does grow nonetheless.\n\nTherefore, my question is: given these assumptions, do you think we will one day reach a point where the human lifespan is not long enough to learn mathematics to a point where one can contribute to the field, i.e., there is too much stuff to get through before you reach the point where you can do actual research.\n\nWe can _kinda_ (and it is a big kinda) see it with Number Theory where the subject presented in multiple undergrad classes is nowhere near where the actual field is research wise, so if one wishes to pursue that branch of mathematics, one must spend a good amount of time getting up to speed contrary to some other field where getting your foot in the door is _easier_ (in the sense that there is much less to learn, not the actual difficulty of the field).",

    "postText": "Humility in mathematics Here\u2019s a short story from my most recent semester as an undergrad. \n\nI took my first \u201cadvanced\u201d course, combinatorics. This was the first class I was truly nervous to take. Previously, each class would \u201cweed out\u201d a few people and the pace would remain slow and introductory. In this course, it was full-fledged math and comp sci majors. Everyone seemed to know what they were doing.\n\nExcept for one guy, we\u2019ll call him M. He asked a lot of questions, some of them seemingly trivial. Every time new notation was introduced, he would raise his hand and ask for clarification. If the professor skipped over something \u201cobvious\u201d in a proof, he\u2019d ask him to include it. \n\nI had multiple classmates come up to me after classes to \u201ccommiserate\u201d about M. \u201cHe clearly shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d \u201che\u2019s not ready for this level,\u201d etc. \n\nM and I studied together often. He came off as extremely bright, studious, and kind. He\u2019s one of the few math majors I know who\u2019s maintained a 4.0. M spent a lot of time in office hours further exploring his questions about the class. \n\nWhen it came time for exams, M was usually among the top scorers. Many of the students who complained about him were not. He also recently won a research grant from the department. \n\nAfter receiving low scores, the same classmates who complained about M either accused him of cheating or blamed the professor\u2019s ambiguous teaching style. \n\nIf you want to succeed, it is on YOU to ask questions \u2014 even if you come off stupid. Pride is the limiting factor for many math students. Sure, wrestle with a problem for a while, sleep on it. But don\u2019t throw in the towel before reaching out for help. I would venture to say that math enthusiasts at every level feel stupid from time to time (for me, it\u2019s pretty much all the time). \n\nOne of my favorite professors told me, \u201cif you ever leave a lecture without questions, you probably didn\u2019t learn enough.\u201d\n\nAsk your questions, and if you aren\u2019t humble or outgoing enough to do so, look up to those who do \u2014 don\u2019t shame them.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a mom of a girl who is into math...how do I not ruin it? My daughter is almost six and she really enjoys math.  (Well, counting and manipulating numbers...I suppose that's really the only thing she's really encountered)  She always wants to read the math books we've gotten (Alice in Numberland and other assorted things like that) and really enjoys those a lot.  Personally, I've put almost zero time into mathematics because I convinced myself that I was horrible at it in high school.  Here's what I'm scared of:  \n\n1.)  Other girls or teachers saying things like \"I hate math\" or that they're not good at it.  She went to school with her favorite color being black and came home with it a week later being pink.  Sigh.  So she picks up what is important or unimportant to other people and wants to adapt herself to that.\n\n2.)  I know that there is actual math out there, and not the things that students do in school.  However, my underlying structure of math is extremely weak.  I'd love to introduce her to logic or patterns or whatever else would help her the most or ignite the most joy for her, but I'm at a loss because I don't really know those things myself.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on these fears?  Any games, curricula, videos or books that would help us...erm, math better?  What did you like doing when you were a kid?\n\nIn closing, help?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:  Holy cow, I just want to say thank you to everyone who has taken the time to give all these incredibly thoughtful responses.  I've read every single comment (and will continue to do so) and taken copious notes!  Thank you for being kind enough to help out!",

Preface with I am not a mathematician. I set out to find if there are bigger objects like the 3,4,5 triangle just out of curiosity on a coffee break. I found:\n\n- 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 + 14^2\n\n- 21^2 + 22^2 + 23^2 + 24^2 = 25^2 + 26^2 + 27^2\n\nI set out to find more... then found:\n\n- 36^2 + 37^2 + 38^2 + 39^2 + 40^2 = 41^2 + 42^2 + 43^2 + 44^2\n\n- 55^2 to 60^2 = 61^2 to 65^2.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight into what I found? I don't see any good reason why there should exist consecutive squares whose sum is the next set (less one object) of consecutive squares.\n\n- I'd like to postulate that there are infinitely many. Is this proven?\n- Each new one I find has one more term on each side of the equation. Does this pattern continue indefinitely?\n- It seems similar to Pythagorean theorem. Is it something like a 3,4,5 triangle in higher dimensions or is it completely unrelated?\n- Does it extend to a larger set of numbers (like cubes following the same pattern)?\n\n___\n\nBonus: I'm almost certain that to someone (or maybe most of you) on here this will be trivial and obvious, but for me randomly stumbling on this it feels personally like I've discovered the atom or something.\n\n- How often do mathematicians get this sense of awe at discovering something?",

I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics, and since the pandemic has changed how universities worked for the past couple of years, my approach to mathematics and interactions has changed, just like everyone else. I have felt starved for the casual mathematical discussions that would happen in the hallways with my colleagues, and conferences are fundamentally different from what they were before the pandemic. (Some changes for better and others for worse).\n\nFor my graduate classes, I have been posting everything to YouTube, since it's nearly impossible for me to maintain any sort of schedule with two toddlers in the house (and hence kills any chance of synchronous teaching). My conversations with my graduate students are mostly through email and about once a month we chat through Teams or FaceTime.\n\nInterestingly, I discovered how useful Reddit can be. I have always dismissed it as yet another Twitter/FaceBook/News Aggregator/etc. But over the last half year or so, as I've been sharing my creations on here (both academic and YouTube), I have been engaged in a lot of great conversations. It has spurred on some collaborations that I didn't expect, and I have even heard from some big guys in my field that got wind of what I was doing from other people here on Reddit.\n\nNow the first place I take an idea that I want to pass by people is Reddit. Leave it to redditors to give a blunt and honest appraisal of your work, and truly, you need that in math to keep you honest.\n\nCheers to the r/math community! You've helped me out a lot, and you help me feel less alone (mathematically) during this pandemic.",

And Einstein is not known to have said that. But an actual quote by Richard Feynman is in the title of this discussion. Here goes the story:\n\n> Richard Feynman, the late Nobel Laureate in physics, was once asked by a Caltech faculty member to explain why spin one-half particles obey Fermi Dirac statistics. Rising to the challenge, he said, \"I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it.\" But a few days later he told the faculty member, \"You know, I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don't understand it.\"\n\nI think this is a more interesting spin because it's more actionable. It defines the task:\n\n- Give a single lecture about the topic\n- Give to freshmen who've come here to learn math\n\nNow do you agree or disagree with this quote? Can a meaningful lecture be given about any topic that we (collective mathematicians) understand well enough? Or are there some topics that are well understood but not even the best explainer could give a freshman lecture on it?",

I am a pretty solid tournament chess player and I often realize that when I sleep less, even if I do not feel tired at all, I tend to lose many rating points. Same with exams, if you do not sleep enough you WILL under-perform, there is no point in trying to cram extra knowledge the night before (unless you are absolutely screwed). My advice would be to get at least 7 hours of sleep each night. Also eating well and going to the gym or doing physical activity has been proven to be very beneficial, go have a nice walk at the park and you will do better in your exams. Aim to go there as lucid as possible, so that even if you did not cover as much, you will be able to critically think your way around it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck to all of you! :D",

The fundamental theorem of calculus demonstrates that if you integrate a derivative, then you get the original function back.\n\nThis simple idea tied together with a little Hilbert space and operator theory has become the keystone of my work over the past three or four years. My group and I have published paper after paper making aspects of data science and nonlinear dynamical systems better using the product of these three concepts, which we call occupation kernels.\n\nWe have brought in over a million dollars in grant money for our work, all on the back of the FTC and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. One YIP, an NSF grant, and an AFOSR grant.\n\nIt really blows my mind sometimes. Having a solid understanding of fundamentals can really open up opportunities that others miss. I am just grateful that we had the wherewithal to put these ideas together.\n\nWhat surprisingly simple idea has had a major impact on your work? Or have you been surprised to find a simple theorem leveraged to resolve a big problem in some circumstance?\n\nEDIT: So around 300 upvotes is apparently when imposter syndrome kicks in lol. I thought this post would get a little attention, and we'd have a nice conversation about system identification. I am overwhelmed with the positive reception here. You guys are great :)",

    "postText": "TIL That I Was Never Bad At Math, I Just Learned The Foundations Through Abuse. Hey! I just found this about myself and I thought this would be a good place to share it. Maybe it can help someone, or maybe I'll find some people like me. \n\nEver since I was little, I always labeled myself as \"bad at math\". I was afraid of homeworks and test, afraid of math teachers and textbooks. It wasn't something completely irrational, after all I had and still have a severe case of math anxiety, which was always \"proven\" by the fact that I can't do basic things as easely as most people can. I still have to use my fingers to add and subtract things like 5 + 7, I have to use a calculator to divide stuff because I forgot how to do it by hand, I don't know how to factorize at all and I don't remember the rules of basic operations with fractions. Now, I hear you saying \"Well, that IS being bad at math\" and I would normally agree with you and hate myself for it. But after taking a long look at myself, I discovered that it may not be my fault.\n\nEnter my dad. My dad is a very good dad. He always makes his best effort to give our family a life of relative luxury, something that an engineer with masters like him can do. Something that he isn't good at however, is being a teacher. When he switches to his teacher persona it's like he stops being my dad and turns into a horrible college professor.  He is impatient, cruel,  verbally and sometimes physically violent, and a tad abusive. He snapped at the slightest mistake and slapped me in the back of the head with each error. He was talking on the phone the other day and I noticed how I felt tense and on edge when he spoke, and I remembered that the tone of voice he was using was the same severe tone he used when doing homework with me, it's like he conditioned me to be on my guard with just his voice, it's incredible. I remember the time I had to learn the multiplication tables, he sat with me every night for that week with a belt in his hand to \"learn\" the multiplication tables. Apparently this experience is somewhat common between people my age, so I disregarded it without considering how it affected me.\n\nI never considered that the reason I'm slow at math is because I never truly learned the most basic concepts, I just memorized them to get out *that* situation, but I never truly learned them. I memorized the tables at some point, but it was only to avoid the belt, after that I forgot most of them. That wasn't learning, that was a survival tactic, and that's messed up. Over time, I got used to memorizing instead of learning. At some point in Highschool I started cheating and I started to avoid dad helping me because \"I was doing fine\". That was all that mattered to me, avoiding him. Because I would rather cheat that learn his way. It was at college that I realized how grave my mistake was and how behind I was compared to the rest. \n\nEnter coding. During my last year of highschool I decided that I wanted to study Software Engineering, since everyone talked about how coding is a well payed job and no one told poor young Alsentar how much math skills that would require. I started to learn coding by myself, taking small youtube courses of the basics. Through flow diagrams on programs like Pseint and Raptor I learned basic concepts like variables, use PEMDAS in code, conditions, loops, etc. After that I started learning Java, going as far as learning bidimensional arrays and basic interface design with buttons that could do basic functions. I made a program that could display the interface of a calculator that could do PEMDAS, with buttons and stuff, and I regarded that calculator as my magnum opus. I was happy back then, because from my perspective, coding wasn't math, coding was a set of tools in which you used math. This was the main reason I chose software engineering, because I thought I could be an engineer saying \"I'm a professional programmer, but math isn't my forte. No one is perfect\". \n\nToday I'm on my second year at college, still at software engineering. I'm one of the best programmers in my class and I get asked for help a lot. I'm having lots of trouble learning my calculus, but I manage thanks to an amazing teacher I got this semester. She's kind and patient, and she doesn't mind repeating herself if someone gets lost. Whenever I realize that I understand how to do the exercise I feel so happy, and those dopamine hits I get when I finish an example and I get it right? Nothing beats that, I feel so proud of myself. I see how good I am with my coding, I see how everyone says that math and coding are intertwined with logic and how I react when I understand math, and I wonder, am I really bad at math? or do I just have very poor foundations? and after reflecting for a while, here I am.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind responses. For those of you wondering, I'm latino and I'm 20 years old. It's a stereotype we're all tired of seeing, but sadly latino parents are sometimes violent with their kids.",

    "postText": "[RANT]: People's attitude towards maths and its education sucks Bit of context first: I'm Asian and where I'm from, cram schools are very popular. Long story short, these places are where any sort of (mathematical) curiosity is killed ruthlessly, and students are taught to only apply computations formulaically.\n\nI'm trying to get my parents to not send my sister to a maths cram school, for reasons established above. However, they keep dismissing my arguments, by accounts of the fact that I study maths at uni and therefore I'm special (I'm not), about how by not going to one of those places, she will develop an independent study habit, which will help her in the long run. Furthermore, if she does fail from time to time, those experiences will teach her self-responsibility, which I'd argue is a lot more important than a shiny GPA. Also, my sister's been doing just fine at school till this point, so going to a cram school seems to serve zero purpose. But most importantly, I don't want my sister to grow up hating maths because she's gonna be drilled by these cram schools. It's such a beautiful subject and I'd love her to give it at least a chance before dismissing it.\n\nSorry if the post is not entirely appropriate.

    "postText": "Genius meets Lunatic: 1994 discussion between Terry Tao and Ludwig Plutonium I was finally able to dig up an old sci.math Usenet group discussion between one of the world's greatest mathematicians (Terry Tao -- though this was way before he won his field medal) and one of the Internet's greatest lunatics ([Ludwig Plutonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_personality#Eccentric_believers), who has changed his name several times over the years), so I'd thought I'd share it here and ask if people have other great examples of discussions like this.\n\nI think this is a great example of how many great mathematicians are open to communicating with just about anybody.  I have other examples like this, but this one is by far my favourite.  Of course there is the case of when Hardy opened his mind to considering Ramanujan -- before Ramanujan was known to the world, and Hardy had no reason to believe he was anything serious until he tried out a few of the formulas that were posted to him.  So that's another example, but let's get back to Tao and Plutonium.\n\nHere's the good stuff:\n\n- Plutonium claims to have [two proofs of the Riemann Hypothesis](https://groups.google.com/g/sci.math/c/2m-jqsZYZW8/m/ExLjMoDO9soJ).  I don't think this is readable by most mathematicians.  It certainly starts off pretty crazy, trying to link the Zeta function to protons, electrons, and neutrons: that was classic Ludwig, and no I will not try to explain any of this craziness.\n\n- [Terry Tao's reply](https://groups.google.com/g/sci.math/c/2m-jqsZYZW8/m/mzsA_xkg26YJ).  It is amazing that Tao makes sense out of a lot of what Plutonium writes, and even says at the beginning that Ludwig is \"absolutely correct so far.\"  Towards the middle, Tao finds problems, saying \"This already makes this proof invalid, but let's continue anyway.\"  And the more Tao goes, the more flaws he finds.\n\nIn the reply after that, Plutonium writes: \"I HAVE MADE SOME TYPOS, AND MINOR ERRORS IN MY 9JAN94, 16:30:33 GMT POSTING.\"  Sorry about the all caps, I am just cut-and-pasting his text.  I think he gets the time of the post wrong, but yeah he gets a lot of things wrong.  What I find significant about this quoted text is that this is the only time I have ever seen Plutonium admit being wrong to anything.\n\nI hope this brings a smile to some of the people here who have been around internet discussions for a very long time.  I'd be keen to see of other examples like this, or even similar stories whether they are documented or not.  Thank you for reading.\n\n\"There's a fine line between genius and insanity\"\n\nEDIT: Changed \u201cUsenix\u201d error to \u201cUsenet\u201d",

OK I guess. So that was kind of exciting, despite being a bit stupid. So then I emailed a combinatorics professor and asked him if he had any further idea on how to make it nicer and he's like, I think the identity you have is the pfaffian of a matrix. So I read the wiki page of the pfaffian, and realize that what I basically proved is the equivalence between 2 different definitions of the pfaffian, for a specific class of matrices. I also realize that instead of writing out the proof I wrote initially, I can just take that equivalence for granted and use it to calculate not just this specific case of the trace of gamma matrix-involving quantities, but a bunch of others too. So that was cool. \n\nOn one hand, nothing I did was truly hard and I wasn't even the one who made the connection with the pfaffian. Plus it's probably not terribly useful.

    "postText": "So I've played around with factorials and... ...I've found something cool! (I think)\n\nI have no idea if this is already known, and if it is, then I'd love to know more about it, but let me explain first:\n\nI came up with a relatively simple equation involving factorials and at first I thought I've figured out a way to find new primes (obviously, I didn't) but what I did figure out is still interesting nonetheless.\n\nThe equation basically N! - (1! + 2! + 3! + ... + (N-1)!)\n\nNow the equation is not to interesting at first glance, but after coding a quick way to solve it, I've noticed something very strange:\n\nIf N is higher than 4, the last digit will always be the same: 7\n\nThen I noticed that the number of digits that are the same at the end increases with every 5th iteration by 1, with every 25th iteration by 2 and with every 125th iteration by 3. (I guess this goes on with every power of 5)  \nThe first 25 numbers generated by the equation are the following:\n\n    1                           1\n    2                           1\n    3                           3\n    4                          15\n    5                          87\n    6                         567\n    7                        4167\n    8                       34407\n    9                      316647\n    10                    3219687\n    11                   35878887\n    12                  435046887\n    13                 5704064487\n    14                80428314087\n    15              1213746099687\n    16             19521187251687\n    17            333363035571687\n    18           6024361885107687\n    19         114864714882483687\n    20        2304476522241459687\n    21       48529614677597619687\n    22     1070348458111786419687\n    23    24674363741441547699687\n    24   593418731996911033779687\n    25 14863731971861418139059687\n\nLike I said, I have written a bit of code that allows me to generate these numbers for a automatically, and I've even written a function to only generate the part that is being repeated in the inputs set of 5. Let me know if you're interested in it, although It is very simple and can be written by anyone with a bit of coding experience.\n\nI've also noticed some more peculiarities like the fact that every Nth number where N is divisible by 5 already has one more repeating digit at the end. This digit is always the next generated repeating digit found in the following set of 5, if read from right to left.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is that the last digit before the repeating digit's start seem to follow a pattern of sorts. The first two numbers after a number generated from N, where N is divisible by 5, always have the same two digits as there last digits before the repeating digits start. (e.g. lines 11 & 12 have 8 as there last digit before the repeating digits start)\n\nAs you might imagine with factorials, the numbers get quite large, rather quickly, but the patters holds up even if N=1000.\n\nI have no idea if this is even useful or just strange but ultimately boring, but I'm not a mathematician and that's why I came here! If you have any more info on what I described here, let me know!\n\nThank you!",

    "postTitle": "The unreasonable effectiveness of physics in mathematics: quantization in K\u00e4hler geometry",
    "postText": "The unreasonable effectiveness of physics in mathematics: quantization in K\u00e4hler geometry Recently Kewei Zhang provided a [new proof](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02438.pdf) of the *uniform Yau--Tian--Donaldson conjecture for Fano manifolds*, a central problem in K\u00e4hler geometry which was resolved (at least in the same generality as Zhang's new proof) in 2012 by Chen--Donaldson--Sun. This appeared in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/lnuqn6/resolution_of_the_finite_generation_conjecture/) about the same area, which was more concerned with significant advancements in the algebraic-geometry side of the theory.\n\nThis paper jumped out to me as a somewhat incredible application of a purely physical idea to K\u00e4hler geometry, that really has no business working as well as it does. The concept of *quantization* is of course central in physics, and there are certain contexts in which it makes sense mathematically, but the novelty of Zhang's paper is taking a very hard \"classical\" problem (the existence of a K\u00e4hler--Einstein metric on a complex manifold), \"quantizing\" it (turning it into a problem on some Hilbert spaces that algebraic approaches let us solve), and then \"taking the classical limit\" to return to the original problem. Whilst this proof is fundamentally mathematically rigorous, the fact that it works seems to me to be very deep and be intimately related to the nature of quantization in physics.\n\nHopefully I will be able to impart, to the interested reader, why this paper caught my eye.\n\n#Yau--Tian--Donaldson conjecture\n\nVery briefly, the YTD conjecture asserts that solutions to a very hard global PDE on compact complex manifolds, the [K\u00e4hler--Einstein equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler%E2%80%93Einstein_metric), exist precisely when a certain *purely algebro-geometric* condition is satisfied, called [K-stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-stability). In principle, this algebraic condition is meant to be \"much easier\" to check than doing some kind of hard analysis to prove existence of the PDE some other way, so the YTD conjecture *takes a hard problem in geometric analysis and converts it to an easier problem in algebra*. In practice it turns out that K-stability is also very hard to check, not because it is equally as hard as solving the PDE, but because it turns out algebra is also very hard!\n\nJust to explain the term \"uniform\" in the title of Zhang's article, K-stability takes the form\n\n\"for every (**X**,**L**) associated to a compact complex manifold (X,L), the rational number DF(**X**,**L**) is strictly positive.\"\n\nUniformity here means that instead we say \n\n\"there is an \u03b5 > 0 such that DF(**X**,**L**) is bounded away from zero by at least \u03b5\"\n\nso uniform K-stability => K-stability.\n\n#Quantization\n\nIn physics, quantization is a process of taking a classical system, and turning into a quantum system. To a geometer, a classical physical system is synonymous with a [symplectic manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold). Using classical mechanics terminology, the symplectic manifold should be thought of as the space of classical *states* of the system, where each point represents a particular state, and the symplectic form should be thought of as somehow encoding the laws of physics that govern the evolution of those states. Namely if a Hamiltonian is fixed (this is a function on the symplectic manifold that assigns to each state a number, the total energy of that state), then the evolution of that physical system is given by the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field associated to the Hamiltonian using the symplectic form. If you write down what this actually means you get exactly Hamilton's equations of motion.\n\nTo a geometer, quantization is a procedure that takes in this data of a symplectic manifold, and produces a Hilbert space of \"quantum states,\" and a rule which takes the \"classical observables\" (smooth functions on the symplectic manifold) to \"quantum observables\" (operators on the Hilbert space) in such a way that the [canonical commutation relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_commutation_relation) are satisfied for those operators. This process is not fully understood mathematically, except in certain special circumstances. \n\nOne of these circumstances is called [geometric quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_quantization), which attempts to define this Hilbert space and the operators on it entirely using the geometry of the symplectic manifold. The ideas behind geometric quantization are generally sound, but it tends to only work well for compact symplectic manifolds (which the phase spaces of actual interest in real world physics are not) along with several other assumptions. \n\n#Geometric quantization\n\nHow does geometric quantization work? Broadly, a \"quantum state\" should be thought of as a distribution of classical states \"smeared out.\" One way to make this rigorous is to view a quantum state as some kind of function or distribution on the symplectic manifold of classical states. Physicists like to take L^2 functions because they work well with Fourier transforms and wave-particle duality, so a best guess for the right Hilbert space might be L^2(X, **C**), the space of (**C**-valued) L^2 functions on the symplectic manifold X. This turns out to be wrong in two ways:\n\n1. Locally this is basically right, but globally your Hilbert space of quantum states needs to reflect the non-trivial geometry of your symplectic manifold. It turns out the correct space to consider is instead the space of *L^2 sections of a prequantum line bundle*, which is a line bundle L-> X over your symplectic manifold such that the symplectic form represents its first Chern class (if you like, the line bundle twists in exactly the way the symplectic geometry of X prescribes). Sections of this line bundle look exactly like functions L^2(X,**C**) over small open subsets of X, so this isn't much of an issue.\n\n2. This is the critical issue for my post: **the sections of the prequantum line bundle depend on twice as many variables as they should**. To a physicist, state space is always even dimensional, because it has both *position and momentum coordinates*, but the quantum states should be *either* a function of position or momentum coordinates, but not both. Therefore you need a rule for how to cut down the number of coordinates your functions depend on by half.\n\n#Cutting down the coordinates by half: polarisations\n\nThere are several possible ways of cutting down the number of coordinates your quantum states depend on. The most obvious idea is to take a Lagrangian submanifold inside your symplectic manifold (a Lagrangian submanifold is like a \"position slice\" of your symplectic manifold) and then take functions defined on that Lagrangian. This is more or less what a *real polarisation* is. (as an aside for those interested, the cotangent bundle to a Lagrangian should be thought of as the \"position + momentum coordinates\" and it turns out every Lagrangian can be viewed as sitting inside its cotangent bundle with the [tautological symplectic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautological_one-form) by a truly remarkable theorem in symplectic geometry, the *Weinstein tubular neighbourhood theorem*).\n\nAnother possible method of cutting down the dependencies by half is instead of taking functions f(x1,y1,...,xn,yn), formally replace (x1,y1) by a complex coordinate z1=x1 + i y1, and then make your functions depend on n complex coordinates f(z1,...,zn). To make this rigorous on a manifold you get a *complex structure* which must be compatible with the symplectic structure, in other words you get a [K\u00e4hler manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_manifold)! For this reason, this trick of is called taking a K\u00e4hler polarisation. Precisely, the space of quantum states you take is now the *holomorphic* sections of the prequantum line bundle, rather than the arbitrary smooth (or L^(2)) sections.\n\nIt turns out there is a way of passing between these two different perspectives (see [here for some discussion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9912054.pdf)), at least in the case of X=**R**^(2n) = **C**^(n), so physicists view both the \"real polarisation\" or \"K\u00e4hler polarisation\" perspective as unitarily equivalent ways of producing the space of quantum states.\n\nLet me summarise the above into a key point:\n\n**Physics predicts that the correct Hilbert space to quantize a symplectic K\u00e4hler manifold X is the space of holomorphic sections of a line bundle which is represented by the K\u00e4hler form of X.**\n\n#Polarisations in algebraic geometry, and Zhang's paper\n\nNow by what I can only deem to be a fairly incredible coincidence, there is a name for line bundles on complex manifolds which are represented by a K\u00e4hler form: **polarisations**. A pair (X,L) of a manifold X and a **C**-line bundle over it which is represented by a K\u00e4hler form is called a polarised manifold. \n\nIn algebraic geometry when you have one of these line bundles, which for us is now a prequantum line bundle, the space of holomorphic sections is a well-understood vector space of a lot of importance:\n\nIf (X,L) is a polarised manifold, then X embeds inside the projective space P(V^(k)) where V^(k) is the *space of holomorphic sections of kth tensor power of L*. This is essentially the [Kodaira embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaira_embedding_theorem) if you are a differential/complex geometer or the definition of an [ample line bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ample_line_bundle) if you are an algebraic geometer.\n\nIn an old conference proceedings from the 13th international congress on mathematical physics, which is impossible to access online, Simon Donaldson explained how one could view the study of embeddings of a K\u00e4hler manifold inside these Hilbert spaces V^(k) as studying the \"quantization\" of the original K\u00e4hler manifold itself, which remember should be thought of as a \"classical\" object, since a K\u00e4hler manifold is a symplectic manifold. This idea is explained in more detail in Richard Thomas's brilliant [notes on GIT and symplectic reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0512411).\n\nMore or less, since V^(k) is just a vector space, one can study inner products on it, and each inner product induces a [Fubini--Study metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%E2%80%93Study_metric) on the projective space. This metric can be restricted to X which is sitting inside P(V^(k)), and serves as a \"quantum approximation\" to the original K\u00e4hler metric on X.\n\n#The unreasonable effectiveness of physics in mathematics\n\nThe classical limit of this quantum theory occurs as k->infinity, where Thomas explains that a basis of sections for L^k tend to peak more and more, supported on balls of smaller and smaller radius about the points of X. In this way the quantum vector space of sections of L^k slowly returns back to describing the original space X itself.\n\n**This means that one can study problems on the classical space by solving the corresponding quantized problem on the vector spaces V^(k), and then taking a classical limit back.**\n\nImportantly, the only reason we predict that this mathematically should work in K\u00e4hler geometry is because **physics predicts that spaces of holomorphic sections should be the correct Hilbert spaces to quantize a symplectic manifold.** This seems to me to be a remarkable interplay between maths and physics, where physics predicts that a certain scheme should work to solve problems by approximation in K\u00e4hler geometry for no reason other than the fact that quantum state spaces should depend on half the variables on a symplectic manifold, and it turns out that this idea is so natural mathematically that it can be applied to a very complicated problem in K\u00e4hler geometry and produce a new proof of a major conjecture!\n\nZhang goes on to exploit this idea by defining functionals on the space V^(k) which approximate a certain key functional on the space of K\u00e4hler metrics on X itself, and shows that critical points of those functions approaches a critical point of the functional on X in the classical limit. The details of Zhang's paper are not so important for my post, just the idea executed so effectively.\n\n##TLDR:\n\nPhysics predicts that the naive process of quantizing a classical system mathematically depends on twice as many variables as it should, because symplectic manifolds have both position and momentum coordinates, but quantum states should depend on either position or momentum. One way of cutting the number of coordinates in half is to pass to complex coordinates and require your quantum states to be holomorphic. This idea coming out of quantum mechanics is so natural that in complex geometry it can be used to approximate \"classical\" problems about K\u00e4hler manifolds by solving \"quantum\" problems about Hilbert spaces of holomorphic sections, and then \"passing to a classical limit,\" a process which we would **only** predict works because the quantum mechanics tells us it should.\n\nThis is just one in a long list now of physical principles providing a guide towards how to resolve mathematical problems. String theory and mirror symmetry provide many such examples, and even the very study of \"Einstein manifolds\" and \"Yang--Mills connections\" are examples of how the naturality of objects in physics seems to predict their naturality in mathematics.",

    "postTitle": "In Defense of Algebra",
    "postText": "In Defense of Algebra Lately, I've been growing concerned about the increasing influence of the argument that advanced high school math classes are somehow unnecessary or not worth putting students through. While I do think there are a lot of things that can be improved about the current state of U.S. math education, I feel an urge to defend a subject that I love and think is essential learning for all students. I've summarized my best arguments for advanced high school math education below:\n\n1. **Math is beautiful:** writing a proof is a meditative experience that can make you feel closer to the universe and improve your abstract reasoning ability. Replacing this with something more \"practical\" like a class on paying taxes would be like replacing literature with a car owner's manual.\n2. **Math is hard:** out of all high school subjects, math is probably the hardest to master without feedback from an instructor and peers.  We should be giving students more structure rather than less.\n3. **Math is useful**: Math is a really powerful way to describe the world. Because of this, many of the highest-paying jobs in tech and finance rely heavily on advanced math. If we discontinue advanced math education (even voluntarily on the part of students) for populations at schools in low-income neighborhoods, we make it harder to identify the students with the talent for these positions and stifle social mobility.\n4. **Mathematicians make good citizens:**  We live in an increasingly complex world, where policy-makers rely more and more heavily on statistics and mathematical models. Mathematical understanding is key to helping the citizens of tomorrow cast more informed votes.\n\nIf math education is so bad, is there anything we can do to fix it? I'm less sure about this, but I've included two proposals below:\n\n1. **Let kids write proofs!** Why we keep students so far away from what mathematicians actually do is beyond me. This is the fun stuff, let's get them engaged. Bonus: longer retention of information and more self-contained classes, decreasing impact of disruptions like a pandemic.\n2. **Have students read arguments that use applied math.** Reading science and econ papers that use statistics and other applied math techniques (especially ones that get things wrong) will help students evaluate mathematical arguments in the real world. Bonus: they will also get a better sense of what non-mathematicians actually use math for.\n\nI've included a longer form of this argument in a [substack post](https://neuralnetworking.substack.com/p/in-defense-of-algebra), which you should feel free to check out.\n\nI'm curious to know if any of you have another argument I haven't thought of or another suggestion to improve math education. Also, let me know if you think I'm straw-manning the position I'm arguing against here. (I should note that a lot of editorials like [this one](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/is-algebra-necessary.html) suggest replacing algebra and calculus with a stats course, not eliminating upper-level math entirely. I address this more nuanced argument in the substack post.)\n\nEDIT: I've been getting a lot of great and really thoughtful responses that have updated how I think about this. I thought I would briefly give my thoughts on some points that have come up a few times:\n\n* **You're overestimating high school students/the capacity of teachers:** This is probably somewhat true. There are students who are really not capable and/or totally uninterested in learning math, and I'm not sure we should force them to. On the other hand, I think some of you might be underestimating the bulk of high school students. There are plenty of proofs and applied math arguments that are not more complicated than the lots of fiddly calculations that go along with higher-level algebra/calculus. I am only a few years out of a pretty normal public high school and it's my impression that my fellow students could have handled these topics well. I am very sympathetic to the point that teachers have to teach what's on state tests. It might be hard to change much of the curriculum without public policy change, but I still think introducing some proofs/applied math concepts could improve understanding without hurting test performance. Note that although I have spoken to some teachers I am close to about this, I am speaking about pedagogy from a student's perspective, so take my solutions with a grain of salt.\n* **Mathematicians can be bad people:** I concede this point. In (4), I was trying to make the case that a mathematically literate population will make more informed/rational choices. I think this would be a good thing even holding constant everyone's current level of morality. If I come up with a method to make everyone perfectly moral, I'll let you all know.\n* **#notalljobs:** As many people have pointed out, there are plenty of people who make lots of money as doctors or lawyers or other professions that don't use a lot of math. This is a fair point. My personal experience at Yale has been that a lot more of my soon-to-be-rich peers are going into mathy fields than I would have predicted in high school. A longer treatment of this issue can be found [here](https://neuralnetworking.substack.com/p/ambition-the-elite-job-market-and).\n\nEDIT 2: It's going to be hard to respond to all the comments, so I thought I would just list a couple of ways my view has been updated by all of your feedback.\n\n* I placed too much emphasis on the aesthetic argument, which is less convincing than I initially believed and quite dependent on the individual.\n* I should consider computer science/programming. As someone who has flirted quite a bit with math in college but is actually a C.S. major, I'm very sympathetic to the argument that programming should probably have been included as part of a solution here.\n* I should address the case of students who are really unwilling/unable to learn upper-level math. This is an unfortunate situation and I don't really have good ideas for a perfect resolution.",

Having known for a long time that the real numbers were uncountable, I thought I had pretty good intuition (built beginning with diagonalisation argument) for that uncountability. But then I thought in more detail on the nature of the computable numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The computable numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number) are those reals which, roughly, we can write a computer program to print out as much of their decimal expansion as we want. For instance, sqrt(2) is computable, there are many algorithms for finding square roots to arbitrary precision, and pi is computable, maybe you could find it using sqrt(6(1+1/4+1/9+1/16+...)).\n\nBut there are only countably many computer programs that one could write (that is to say, you could list them in some order), so there are only countably many such numbers. Likewise, the only real numbers that we can really *know* (in the sense that we can start writing them out) are the computable ones. What we think of, what we are actually able to think of (in that sense) are only those in a countable subset of uncountable infinity that is the real numbers.\n\nSo when we can't really even think about a single non-computable number (except in the sense that we can describe, say, [Chaitin's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant))  it's not so easy to assert that I *know* what an uncountable infinity feels like.\n\nI'm know some of you will probably disagree, but I think that it's worth sharing.",

    "postText": "Ex-NSA mathematicians doing a post-quantum crypto AMA tomorrow [Quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) is a completely different paradigm from classical computing, where weird quantum properties are combined with traditional boolean logic to create something entirely new. There has long been much doubt about whether it was even possible to build one large enough to solve practical problems. But when something is labeled \"impossible\", of course many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians eagerly respond with \"[Hold my beer!](http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hold-my-beer-14.jpg)\". QCs have an immense potential to make a global impact (for the better!) by solving some of the world's most difficult computational problems, but they would also crush the math problems underpinning much of today's internet security, presenting an unprecedented challenge to cryptography researchers to develop and standardize new [quantum-resistant primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) for the post-quantum internet.\n\nA coworker and I will be doing an AMA tomorrow at 1pm EDT to talk about post-quantum crypto. We are mathematicians that trained in crypto at NSA and worked there for over 10 years. For the past year or so we've been working at a small crypto sw/hw company called [Envieta Systems](http://envieta.com/) on a post-quantum research effort, and we've been reading a broad spectrum of the current research. Much of current public key crypto is based on the hidden subgroup problem over abelian groups, but this is crushed by [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm). \nSome of the crypto primitives under consideration are based on interesting math, like lattices, supersingular isogenies, and multivariate polynomials, so I thought there might be some interest here. I will post a direct link tomorrow before we start.\n\nDisclaimer: We are bound by [lifetime obligations](https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/prepub/), so expect very limited responses about our time at NSA unless you're willing to wait a few weeks for a response from pre-pub review (seriously, I'm joking, we don't want to go through that hassle).\n\nEdit: silly me, forgot the time! Also don't know my time zones and daylight savings.\n\n[Here is the link to the AMA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/67wsur/we_are_exnsa_cryptomathematicians_working_to_help/)",

Oh and I started grad school this month =) Basically don't give up. If you enjoy math and can find a way to put the time and energy into learning it there's no reason you can't learn it. There is no \"either you got it or you don't\" simply that \"either you work as hard as you need to or you don't\". Some spend more hours than others, some people focus more intensely than others, some people study and memorize more efficiently than others, some people enjoy studying math more than others, but we've all got plenty of capacity to learn the most complex and advanced maths on the planet and if your reasons are deeper than a need to \"out compete\" other mathematicians (which I'm not even sure what that means anyway) you will do just fine so long as you put in the effort. Keep it up everyone!  \n\n\nEdit:  If anyone is curious at this university the qual (qualifying exam) is used to qualify you to receive your degree AFTER you enter the program. They are designed to be taken after your first couple semesters and an inability to pass your quals before the end of your 2nd year has negative consequences (like a loss of funding or removal from the program). Incoming graduate students get to take a \"consequence free\" qual in the weeks before their first semester. I took the algebra qual and I got the masters level pass which just means if I want to get out with my masters I only have n-1 quals left. My adviser said that at our university \"not everybody gets a pass on their first attempt\" and that \"this years algebra qual was especially hard and most students failed\". But I spent a lot of the fall 2019 studying algebra so it was surprising but also clealry a consequence of effort as the questions on material I knew I did very well on. I'm actually curious as to what other universities use their qualifying exams or comprehensive exams for. I guess in most places and departments they call it a comprehensive exam but in our department they use it like a comprehensive exam and write it like a comprehensive exam but call it a qual. ",

For context I\u2019m a chemical engineering major currently taking linear algebra at a big engineering college.\n\nI feel like there is a serious problem with how math is taught at the college level, especially in regards to exams. I feel like 95% of the focus is on drilling algorithms and equations into our heads so we can memorize them and use them to do complex calculations by hand over and over. The other 5% is reserved for conceptual understanding of the math and real world applications of the math. At my college, in a calc exam for example, you get 10-12 questions, and the majority of them will give you an integral or some other such equation and tell you to solve. In lecture, the focus of the professor/TA is to tell students *how* to do something, with very little context on *why* they are doing it. I honestly feel like my high school did a better job at teaching math than my college! In high school we would get problems where we would have to find the rate of change of water coming out of a funnel- real world application. We would get projects where we would either have to conceptually explain the math behind some phenomenon or use calculations to evaluate certain properties of a system. These things not only sparked interest in math with students, but it forced them to show an understanding beyond just plugging and chugging. In college, where we shell out thousands of dollars per class, this seemingly great method of teaching math has disappeared.\n\nMy current linear algebra class is a perfect example of what I\u2019m talking about. I can absolutely find the determinant of a matrix, and I can find the basis of its null space. They taught us the methods for doing this. However, if you asked me what any of those things actually are or how they can be applied to any situation other than a linear algebra exam, I wouldn\u2019t be able to answer. Rather than teaching us those things, the things that will stay in our realm of knowledge and make us interested in the subject, they make us memorize algorithms that any computer can do 1000 times faster. Whenever I\u2019m row reducing a 6x6 matrix by hand, I can\u2019t help but wonder what the point of what I\u2019m doing is. I just don\u2019t see how a department filled with education experts and mathematicians can decide to put everything that makes math interesting on the backburner in favor of teaching us rote memorization and equations with no context. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Have you had different experiences at your school? Am I just being salty about exams or do I have a legitimate point?",

    "postTitle": "Why (some) particles have mass and spin",
    "postText": "Why (some) particles have mass and spin There is a [really cool application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_classification) of representation theory to physics which philosophically explains where mass and spin come from (in a sense at least). Let me try to explain this from the ground up to maybe incentivize more people to learn about physics -- there's some really good math in there!\n\nTo begin, in special relativity one equips space-time R\\^4 with a different inner product than usual: g(v, w) = v\\^0 w\\^0 - v\\^1 w\\^1 - v\\^2 w\\^2 - v\\^3 w\\^3 (the upper indices  refer to the components of the vectors, as is customary in physic). To briefly see why, consider that g(v, v) = 0 if and only if (v\\^0)\\^2 = (v\\^1)\\^2 + (v\\^2)\\^2 + (v\\^3)\\^2, which if you think of this as a velocity vector means you're dealing with something that 'moves as much in time as it does in space', i.e. light (using c = 1). It's possible to [push this logic further](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivations_of_the_Lorentz_transformations#Invariance_of_interval) to show that all observers agree on this inner product. That is to say that the allowable changes of coordinates in R\\^4 are those which preserve this metric. The ones fixing the origin are automatically linear and form the Lorentz group O(1, 3), whose connected component of the identity is SO+(1,3) (the Lorentz transformations that preserve both time and space orientations). If you also allow translations of spacetime you get the Poincar\u00e9 group (with connected component of the identity) R\\^4 |x SO+(1,3) (this is my shitty ASCII attempt at a semi-direct product sign).\n\nNow let's bring quantum mechanics into the picture. In QM, the state of a system is described via a vector in a Hilbert space. So let's suppose we want a Hilbert space which describes the possible states of some type of elementary particle. If we want a relativistic theory, then different observers should agree on the state -- this doesn't mean they see the same state, but rather that given an element of the Poincar\u00e9 group, there should be a unitary transformation of this Hilbert space that maps the state one of them sees to the state the other sees. This means our Hilbert space needs to come with a unitary representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group! But actually, not quite -- in QM it makes no difference if you multiply your state vector by some unit complex number. So it should really be a representation 'up to multiplication by a unit complex number', which is called a projective representation. [A theorem of Bargmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem) guarantees that these all come from honest unitary representations of the universal cover, which in our case turns out to be R\\^4 |x SL(2, C). Also, since our particle is supposed to be elementary, we want our representation to be irreducible -- or else we'd be in some sense describing two (or more) possible kinds of particle.\n\nSo the mathematical question presents itself: what are all the possible irreducible unitary representations of the group G = R\\^4 |x SL(2, C)? This is what Wigner did (and later Mackey elevated to a machinery). I'll just tell you what the answer is, but even that requires some setup. Consider some point p in R\\^4, and let H\\_p be the subgroup of elements of SL(2, C) which fix p. It turns out that there is a way to take any irreducible unitary rep of H\\_p and produce another irreducible unitary rep of G. Moreover, all unitary irreps (= irreducible representation) of G arise this way. Let's denote by pi\\_(p, sigma) the unitary irrep of G that comes out of the unitary irrep sigma of H\\_p. Then, finally, two pi\\_(p, sigma) and pi\\_(p', sigma') are equivalent as reps of G if and only if p' = Bp for some B in SL(2, C), and sigma is equivalent to A |-> sigma'(BAB\\^-1).\n\nThe upshot is that we need to understand what are the orbits of SL(2, C) in R\\^4, and for each possible orbit pick a representative point p, understand what is H\\_p (the 'little group of p') and what are its unitary irreps. One type of orbit is: X\\_m+ = {p in R\\^4 | g(p, p) = m\\^2 and p\\_0 > 0} for some real parameter m >= 0. In the m > 0 case we can pick the representative p = (m, 0, 0, 0). Turns out that H\\_p = SU(2)! The irreps of SU(2) are classified by a parameter s = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, .... called the spin -- I could explain this point further but I think the post is getting too long already. (By the way, in the m = 0 case you get a different group, which is why massless particles don't really have spin but something called helicity instead.)\n\nLet me end with one important point: as far as we know, this m is just some real parameter -- what gives us the right to call it mass? Aha - the point is to compute how spacetime translations act according to the representation we obtained. Noether figured out a long time ago that if you differentiate the actions of time and space translations you get energy and momentum respectively! It can be shown that the operator E\\^2 - |p|\\^2 in our setting equals multiplication by m\\^2, reproducing the famous relativity identity E\\^2 = |p|\\^2 + m\\^2 (in some sense). That is why m is really the mass, and that's how massive particles turn out to have spin.",

Here comes one example of what I called the 2-cut theorem (proof is here [https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05422](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05422)).\n\n[The 2-cut theorem.](https://preview.redd.it/c5qwhjefxt751.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b93b6517ad10b82723a02c5b67d31cb2876cd4)\n\nI am now writing the introduction to my thesis and I would like to cite more examples of counterintuitive properties of planar closed curves, like the one above I think it is. It came already to my mind the inscribed square problem, asking whether every Jordan curve admits an inscribed square (pic from [Jordan curves admitting only acyclic inscriptions of squares](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/275439/jordan-curves-admitting-only-acyclic-inscriptions-of-squares)).\n\n[Squares inscribed in a closed simple curve.](https://preview.redd.it/hf9k3x7hxt751.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=f08ffe9716ad3e43204aafbdc99a9f44ec14614d)\n\nSuch a property is still a conjecture for the general case, but proofs have been provided for several special cases and the easier inscribed rectangle problem can be solved with a beautiful topological argument (3Blue1Brown made a very nice video about that [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmgkSdhK4K8&t=169s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmgkSdhK4K8&t=169s)).\n\nApart from the simple pleasure of sharing my result with the community, my question for you is: **what are other surprising/counterintuitive/exotic properties of closed planar curves you are aware of?**",

    "postTitle": "I just defined the \"palindromity\" function on strings and it has some pretty interesting properties",
    "postText": "I just defined the \"palindromity\" function on strings and it has some pretty interesting properties For a string x, let's call its palindromity p(x) the maximum number n of nonempty partitions x\\[i\\] of x, zero-indexed, such that for all i, x\\[i\\] = x\\[n - i - 1\\]. This is essentially extending the notion of palindromes, so instead of asking \"is this a palindrome?\" we are asking \"how *much* of a palindrome is this?\"\n\nThe function has some obvious properties. Words that aren't palindromes at all, like TRUCK, will have a palindromity of 1 because the only partitioning that satisfies the property is simply \\[TRUCK\\].\n\nWords that are full palindromes, like RADAR, will have a palindromity equal to their number of letters, so in RACECAR's case it is 7, because it can be partitioned into \\[R, A, C, E, C, A, R\\].\n\nHowever, what's less intuitive is that some words have a palindromity greater than 1 but less than their length. For example, p(ATLANTA) = 5 because it can be partitioned into \\[A, T, LAN, T, A\\] while satisfying the property. Similarly, p(UNDERGROUND) = 3 \\[UND, ERGRO, UND\\].\n\nIf len(x) is odd, p(x) must also be odd. That's because odd-lettered words always have the center letter in the middle group, meaning there has to be an odd number of groups. But if len(x) is even, p(x) can be either odd or even. Some even-lettered words with odd palindromity include ASIA (3) and TEAPOT (3). Some words of even palindromity include TOTO (2), SHEESH (4), and TEAMMATE (6).\n\nIf p(x) = len(x) / n, where n > 1, we can call x an n-unit palindrome. For example, BONOBO (3) is a 2-unit palindrome and TORMENTOR (3) is a 3-unit palindrome. This concept could also be extended to word-unit palindromes like MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, OWN YOUR MIND, whose palindromity is its number of words, 7. However, this gets a little sticky when the words inside are letter-unit palindromes themselves. \n\nPlease indulge me in this little spurt of recreational ling-math!\n\nDoes this concept already exist elsewhere in math? Could I improve the function definition in any way? Can you find more words with high palindromity that aren't full palindromes? What other observations or properties can you find relating to palindromity? I'm curious to hear your thoughts.",

    "postTitle": "A New Crisis in Mathematics?",
    "postText": "A New Crisis in Mathematics? A recent paper by Borovik, Kocsis, and Kondratiev on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08364) called \"Mathematics and Mathematics Education in the 21st Century\" talks about a new crisis in mathematics. They say in the abstract\n\n>Mathematics enters the period of change unprecedented in its history, perhaps even a revolution: a switch to use of computers as assistants and checkers in production of proofs. This requires rethinking traditional approaches to mathematics education which is struggling through a crisis of its own, socio-economic and political by its nature. The mathematical community faces Pandora's box of problems, which, surprisingly, are not usually discussed in any connected form. The present paper attempts to address this issue in a bit more joint and cohesive way.      \n\nIt is a 22-page paper, which I suggest you read if you want! But I will highlight some points that they make: \n\n1. Cutting-edge mathematical research is moving farther and farther away from stagnating mathematics education (worldwide).\n2. Robots for proof solving are needed! The length and complexity of many very important proofs are \"reaching the limits of human comprehension.\" Thus, without pivoting to computer-based proof assistance and the way math is taught, it is \"likely to enter a spiral of decay\".\n3. In Section 3, they lay out exactly why proof assistants are going to be crucial for students. If this happens, we should expect (I am quoting here)\n   1. mathematics will start re-converging with the theoretical computer science\n   2. some  mathematical  disciplines  may  change  language  to  an equivalent one, which is more suitable for use with the new technology\n   3. new directions of research in mathematics, including those relevant to  exogenous  21st century  challenges  such  as  climate change and the environment, are likely to be developed from the bottom-up in new, proof-assistants-friendly ways\n4. They then lay out the issues for mathematics education in two sections that are regarding the increasing role of abstraction needed for students due to AutoMath and the socio-economic environment due to the financial ability of certain schools and universities. \n5. In the next two sections, the authors take a stab at talking about the \"systematic attack\" on abstract mathematical thinking and then defending abstract thought in the next section. They write: \"The other end of the mathematics spectrum\u2014the elementary mathematics in schools\u2014is under attack from certain quarters for being excessively abstract, too complex and remote from real  life, and  even  worse\u2014for  being  a  weapon  of  intimidation and oppression of historically marginalized peoples.\" They go into detail about a specific case in California where the new curriculum put forth would *de-mathetize math* since it \"Rejects the longstanding goal of preparing students to take  Algebra  I  in eighth grade, on par with high-performing foreign countries whose inhabitants will be future competitors of America\u2019s children \\[. . . \\]\u2014a goal explicitly part of the 1999 and 2006 Math Frameworks.\" Many schools are against abstracting mathematics, and this causes a huge issue. \n6. They then present an argument for abstraction as \"Abstraction is all around us\", \"\"Abstraction is embedded in the real world and mathematics\", and \"Reification\", the process by which an abstract idea about a computer program is turned into an explicit data model. \n7. Lastly, they present the model they feel would help stop this crisis: the Deep Stream.   \nThe goal of this would be to \n\n* developing in children skills of identification of hidden structures in the real world, in IT, in mathematics\n* abstraction\n* reification and encapsulation / de-encapsulation\n* confident handling and creation of proofs\n* confident and fluent computer programming skills \n\nThere is a lot that I have left out, but I would like to pose this question, as a TL;DR.\n\n**Do you feel that there is a crisis in mathematics regarding the difficulty of proofs and level of abstraction? What do you feel is necessary to change about mathematics to fully deal with this issue? Do you agree/disagree with these authors?**\n\nEdit: As a remark that some people have mentioned, Sections 5 and 6 are only by one author. Two of the authors decided to not side with this argument and therefore, it is only one person's opinion.",
